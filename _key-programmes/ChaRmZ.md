# CHARMZ @ BTPS

“**ChaRmz**” supports the BTPS Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) – ***Music for Everyone*** by celebrating the young talents in the various CCAs and school programmes, as well as the talents in our teachers. Members of ***ArtVoice***  also showcase their work in an art exhibition.

“**ChaRmz**” provides opportunities for pupils to appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the diverse forms of music and visual arts. BTPS encourages pupils to interact and forge friendships with peers through music, dance and art, thus fostering social cohesion.
