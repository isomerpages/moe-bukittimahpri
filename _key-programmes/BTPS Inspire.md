# BTPS INSPIRE
![BTPS INSPIRE LOGO](/images/Inspire%20Logo%20final.png)
BTPS Inspire is a unique initiative by Bukit Timah Primary School. It is a school-wide event, tagging along the commemoration of NE Core events and citizenship education. The BTPS Inspire programme started in 2016, following the success of our SG50 Trail, “Creating connections: Reminiscing the Good Old Times at Bukit Timah.” We saw that cross-level interactions and inter-disciplinary subjects help our pupils gain a valuable experience. They learnt from one another and applied what they had learnt from one subject to another. Each year, the structured programme runs from Term 2 to Term 3 and ensures that each level learns skills, knowledge and values pertaining to the co-core subjects, namely social studies, art and music, creating a community of active learners.

Pupils are then given the platform to showcase their works or performances to the school. We also tagged our BTPS Inspire to character strengths development where students have the opportunity to develop their individual character strength of ‘Love of Learning’ through checklists and reflections. This also encourages students to develop a love for learning. Click the link to learn more about BTPS Inspire and watch us in action!
