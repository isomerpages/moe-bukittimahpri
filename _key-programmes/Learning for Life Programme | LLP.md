At Bukit Timah Primary School, we believe that music is a universal language that fuels the hearts and minds of our students, preparing them to be world ready citizens.  To maintain a vibrant musical culture in the school, we have a diverse programme that engages the students and empowers them with basic musical theoretical knowledge. The school aims to develop empathetic learners and resilient individuals through engaging music lessons which allows students to exercise their creativity and thinking skills. Students get to improvise with their voice and instruments, and become critical thinkers as they perform, create, and analyse music.</font><br><br>

<font face="Arial">
School-wide programmes and experiences immerse students in an enhanced musical environment, which in turn provides various opportunities and platforms for students to explore, identify and showcase their talents. In their six years with BTPS, students will determine their own interests and hopefully decide on an area they would be pursuing as a life-long interest. </font></p>

</td><td>P.A.M TV provides an authentic platform for students and staff to promote a healthy lifestyle in Physical and Health Education (P) and showcase their talents in the Aesthetics (Art and Music). It also encourages students who are generally quieter and more reserved to come forward to display their talents. In addition, students who are more articulate could support others by being hosts.
With this platform, students and staff perform in the comfort of their own home or familiar environments. Videos received include artworks, instrumental playing, sports skills and even cooking skills that are beyond the classroom experiences. Parent participation is also encouraged.
