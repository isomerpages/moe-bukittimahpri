At Bukit Timah Primary School, we believe that music is a universal language that fuels the hearts and minds of our students, preparing them to be world ready citizens.  To maintain a vibrant musical culture in the school, we have a diverse programme that engages the students and empowers them with basic musical theoretical knowledge. The school aims to develop empathetic learners and resilient individuals through engaging music lessons which allows students to exercise their creativity and thinking skills. Students get to improvise with their voice and instruments, and become critical thinkers as they perform, create, and analyse music.</font><br><br>

School-wide programmes and experiences immerse students in an enhanced musical environment, which in turn provides various opportunities and platforms for students to explore, identify and showcase their talents. In their six years with BTPS, students will determine their own interests and hopefully decide on an area they would be pursuing as a life-long interest. </font></p>
