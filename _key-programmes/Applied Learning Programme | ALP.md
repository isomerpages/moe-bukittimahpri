<p align="justify">Our ALP is Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) supported by Thinking Routines
(TR), IBL-TR for short. IBL-TR is our school-wide pedagogical approach
to facilitate the pupils’ acquisition of the 21st Century Competencies
due to the elements of thinking, collaborating and creating.</p>
<p align="justify">Through this, we aim to enthuse and empower a self-directed learner with
a passion for learning. Our lessons are designed to facilitate Inquiry-based
Learning supported by the teaching of Thinking Routines (IBL-TR). Opportunities
are created for children to construct their own understanding through exploration,
evidence collecting, communication and application of concepts learnt.
Our teachers believe that when we value pupils’ thinking, this contributes
directly to motivating pupils to be involved in their learning. By focusing
on the thinking process, we give every pupil a voice and reinforce the
fact that every pupil can learn and take charge of their learning.</p>
<p align="justify">To ensure that the “thinking that is required to turn activity into learning”
(Rictchart) is not left to chance, BTPS adopted the Thinking Routines from
Making Thinking Visible: Building Understanding through Critical and Creative
Thinking from Project Zero, Harvard Graduate School of Education.</p>
<p align="justify">These Thinking Routines are used as tools to develop the skills of translating
thoughts and ideas into action and communication. They build the ability
of all pupils to communicate more purposefully to Inquiry-based instruction.
As our pupils in BTPS learn best while working in groups, during the various
phases of inquiry, they can benefit from seeing each other’s thinking process
made visible through the use of Thinking Routines.</p>
<p align="justify">The 5E learning cycle of IBL - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and
Evaluate - is used to craft rich learning experiences that meet the needs
of our students.</p>
<p align="justify">In our classrooms, 5 key learning behaviours that mirror the 5 stages
of Inquiry-based learning are emphasised to teach our pupils how to learn:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Pose Question</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Actively Look for Answers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Explain MY Thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Link What I learn to Life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect on MY Learning</p>
<h4><strong>KEY PROGRAMMES</strong><br>JOURNALING TO ENABLE IBL-TR</h4>
<p align="justify">Journaling is an integral part of education in BTPS. The school firmly
believes that 'Writing enhances critical thinking, reasoning, and the application
of knowledge. It also allows children not only to communicate knowledge
but also to form it' (Ostroff 2012).
<br>Journals serve as a means for teachers to give voice to each child, encouraging
all pupils to express their thoughts. Thinking Routines are widely applied
in journals to cultivate the habit of thinking through one's explanations.</p>
<p align="justify">BTPS students get to do journaling for English, Mathematics, Science and
Mother Tongue.</p>

<p align="justify">The 'Work like a Scientist' programme is a Science initiative designed
for selected Primary 5 students interested in creating opportunities for
them to be self-directed and sparking an interest in the area of Plant
Tissue Culture (PTC).</p>

<p align="justify">Through this program, we aim to instill in children the character strengths
of Perseverance and Teamwork. Students will have the chance to work as
scientists, applying the Science concepts and process skills they learn
in school. Additionally, students will gain insights into the post-PTC
process and how it is used to cultivate carnivorous plants for commercial
purposes.</p>

<p align="justify">Guided by local expert Mr. Darren Ng, whose passion for carnivorous plants
began at the age of 10, students will participate in after-school lab sessions
in our Plant Tissue Culture Lab where they will work with laboratory equipment
used in the cleanroom to grow plants under aseptic conditions. In another
session, they will visit a community garden to interact with plants grown
from tissue cultures.</p>

<h4>SUPER JOURNALING TEAM</h4>

</div>
<p align="justify">The Super Journaling Team (SJT) is a special programme designed for students
who are self-directed and love journaling. Their TED entries, which include
reflection of articles, showcase their deep thinking. SJT members, selected
based on their interest in journaling and writing, would attend master
classes which are conducted outside curriculum hours once every term. They
have opportunities to explore issues and topics from different perspectives
with supporting evidence and reasoning. Learning experiences include a
learning journey to the Last Kampong in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">This exploration aims to understand the reality of Kampong life, drawing
comparisons to the Singlit book by Josephine Chia, 'Growing Up in Kampong
Potong Pasir.’ Students also had the unique opportunity to connect with
a professional chef through a Zoom session.</p>

<p align="justify">After this virtual encounter, they actively participated in a hands-on
baking session, creating delicious cupcakes. This immersive experience
not only provided insight into the culinary profession but also allowed
students to gain practical skills in baking.</p>
