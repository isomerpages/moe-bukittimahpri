# IBL-TR: INQUIRY BASED LEARNING (IBL) SUPPORTED BY THINKING ROUTINES (TR)

At BTPS, we firmly believe that in order to fuel our students’ minds, they must be actively involved in their own construction of knowledge.

Inquiry Based Learning supported by Thinking Routines is used to engage, enthuse and empower a self-directed learner with a passion for learning. The school-wide pedagogical approach facilitates the acquisition of the 21st century skills and competencies through thinking, collaborating and creating.

The 5E learning cycle of IBL - Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate - is used to craft rich learning experiences that meet the needs of our students.

In order to respond positively to Inquiry-based instruction, students learn Thinking Routines\* to articulate their thoughts and develop effective communication.

In our classrooms, 5 key learning behaviours that mirror the 5 stages of Inquiry-based learning are emphasised to teach our pupils how to learn:

1. **I Pose Question**
2. **I Actively Look for Answers**
3. **I Explain MY Thinking**
4. **I Link What I learn to Life**
5. **I Reflect on MY Learning**

\*Thinking Routines are from Making Thinking Visible: Building Understanding Through Critical and Creative Thinking – Harvard Graduate School of Education

# JOURNALING TO ENABLE IBL-TR

Journaling is an integral part of education in BTPS. The school believes that ‘Writing enhances critical thinking, reasoning and applying knowledge. It also allows children to not only communicate knowledge but also to form it” (Ostroff 2012) Journals are one of the ways teachers give a voice to each child, encouraging all pupils to express their thoughts. Thinking Routines are applied widely in journals to develop the habit of thinking through one’s explanations.

BTPS publishes its own journals for English Language – ELLE (P1-2) and TED (P3-P6), Maths – TOM (P1-P6), Science (P3-P6) and Music and Art journals.
