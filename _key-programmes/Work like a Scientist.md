# WORK LIKE A SCIENTIST

Work like a Scientist programme is a Science programme that is rolled out to all Primary 5 pupils who are interested to emulate how scientists work.

In this programme, pupils will get to work with laboratory equipment used in the cleanroom in our Science lab to grow plants under aseptic conditions.

Through the course of the programme, pupils will be able to demonstrate the _love of learning_ by showing _curiosity_. They also get opportunities to _persevere_ and show _resilience_ in the face of challenges, _gain new knowledge_ and pick laboratory _skills_. Through the sessions, pupils are also encouraged to be _open-minded_, _self-directed_ and to _contribute to each others' learning_.
