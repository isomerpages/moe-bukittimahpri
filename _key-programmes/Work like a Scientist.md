# WORK LIKE A SCIENTIST

Work like a Scientist programme is a Science programme that is rolled out to all Primary 5 pupils who are interested to emulate how scientists work. 

In this programme, pupils will get to work with laboratory equipment used in the cleanroom in our Science lab to grow plants under aseptic conditions. 

Through the course of the programme, pupils will be able to demonstrate the *love of learning* by showing *curiosity*. They also get opportunities to *persevere* and show *resilience* in the face of challenges, *gain new knowledge* and pick laboratory *skills*. Through the sessions, pupils are also encouraged to be *open-minded*, *self-directed* and to *contribute to each others' learning*.
