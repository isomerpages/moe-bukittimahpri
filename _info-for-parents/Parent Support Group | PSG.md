BTPS Parent Support Group is a community of parents who seek to partner the school staff in enriching the school life of BTPS students. We are a group of 240 plus parent volunteers who are actively involved with many projects in the school. Our main objective is to enrich the life of our children by working along with the school and infusing the school’s core ethos into our programs. While actively engaging in many school projects, our vibrant parent volunteers have infused their knowledge and skills and thinking into some of these projects to make them more engaging and stimulating for the children.

Over the past years, we have initiated some of the following interesting programs :

**Our Weekly Programs :**

**Buddy Reading** – Held every Monday at the library at 7:00 am. The program provides one-to-one tutoring service for kids who are weak in reading

**English Story Telling** - Conducted every Monday and Thursday at the library during recess. Our aim is to promote good attitudes to reading to the students

**Math Fun** - Conducted every Tuesday during recess. Our aim is to introduce math concepts to students with many creative fun-filled math games

**Mother Tongue Story Telling** - Conducted every Friday during recess. Our aim is to ignite students’ passion for reading in their mother tongue languages - Chinese, Tamil and Malay

**Sports Equipment Loan** – Helping in the registration work when children borrow sports equipment to play during recess every Monday, Tuesday and Thursday
