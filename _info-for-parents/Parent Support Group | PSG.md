<h1>PARENT SUPPORT GROUP</h1><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Photos/PSG.jpg"></div><p>BTPS Parent Support Group is a community of parents who seek to partner the school staff in enriching the school life of BTPS students. We are a group of parent volunteers who are actively involved with many projects in the school. Our main objective is to enrich the life of our children by working along with the school and infusing the school’s core ethos into our programs. While actively engaging in many school projects, our vibrant parent volunteers have infused their knowledge and skills and thinking into some of these projects to make them more engaging and stimulating for the children.</p><p>Over the past years, we have initiated some of the following interesting programs :</p><p><strong>Our Weekly Programs :</strong></p><p><strong>Math Fun</strong> - Conducted every Wednesday during recess. Our aim is to introduce math concepts to students with many creative fun-filled math games.</p><p><strong>English Story Telling</strong> - Conducted every Thursday at the library during recess. Our aim is to promote good attitudes to reading to the students.</p><p><strong>Mother Tongue Story Telling</strong> - Conducted every Friday during recess.
