<strong>School Rules</strong>

<p align="justify">
At BTPS, we believe that rules are necessary to create a safe and conducive environment for our students to learn and play. Every student, when given guidance and support, can learn from his/her mistakes. A shared understanding of expectations from both home and school is the foundation for character growth.
</p>

<strong>1. Respect for Nation and School</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with right fist placed over the heart.</li>
            <li>All students are expected to:
                    </li><li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">Stand at attention during the flag raising ceremony.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">Sing the school song with pride.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">Uphold the school name and school values by behaving with pride and decorum in and outside of the school.</li>
                </ul>
  
<strong>2. Attendance and Late Coming</strong>

    <li style="list-style-type: circle; text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px;">Absences must be covered by a medical certificate (MC) from a registered medical practitioner.</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle; text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px;">Absences for other urgent reasons must be covered by a letter from parent/guardian, to be submitted within a week of the absence. The school will accept up to five letters (one for each occasion) per semester. Please refer to Table 2.1 for valid reasons for absence.</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: circle; text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px;">A student will be considered as playing truant under the following circumstances:
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">He/She is absent from school/lesson/CCA/any other school activity without a medical certificate or valid reason or did not seek prior permission from the teacher-in-charge for the absence.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;">He/She leaves the school grounds after reporting but before the end of the school day, without seeking approval from the teachers and the General Office.</li>
        </ul>
