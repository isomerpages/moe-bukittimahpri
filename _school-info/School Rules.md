<h2>School Rules</h2>

<p align="justify">
At BTPS, we believe that rules are critical to create a safe and conducive environment for our students to learn and play.  Every student, when given guidance and support, can learn from his or her mistakes and mature as leaders of self and persons of influence.  A shared understanding of expectations from both home and school is the foundation for character growth.</p>
