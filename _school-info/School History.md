Bukit Batok East Primary School (started 1959) and Bukit Batok West Primary School (started 1960) were merged in 1984 to form Bukit Batok Primary School. In 2001, the school relocated from Jalan Jurong Kechil to Lorong Kismis and was renamed Bukit Timah Primary School to reflect its location. The school badge was redesigned, and the school song lyrics changed but the school motto “Strive for the Best” has been retained to today as it continues to be relevant, exhorting every generation of BTPS students to do their best. </p>

To mark the official opening of the school in 2003, the school worked closely with the community to create a community symbol – an orchid named Kagawara Bukit Timah which is registered with the Royal Horticultural Society of England. A vibrant orange orchid, the Kagawara Bukit Timah is a hybrid of the Renanthera, Vanda and Ascocentrum species of orchids.</p>

In 2012, the school celebrated its 10th anniversary with performances at Republic Polytechnic Cultural Centre. The occasion was themed “Dare to Dream”. </p>

2014 saw the launch of BTPS’s Learning for Life Programme – Music for Everyone: Building Empathy and Resilience. The LLP provides an immersive experience for our students to explore, identify and showcase their musical talents. In 2015, our Applied Learning Programme – Inquiry Based Learning supported by Thinking Routines began. Over the years, it has been integrated into the school instructional programme to support students in developing creative and critical thinking. </p>

With the celebration of its 20th anniversary in 2022, BTPS looks forward to guiding new generations of students to grow as future and world-ready citizens with sound values.  </p>
