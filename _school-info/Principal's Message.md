From the Principal

I am honoured to be a part of a school that espouses a holistic educational experience for every student, recognises their individuality and yet emphasizes the community. I believe that education is about learning experiences, not just in the classroom but in every aspect of school life. Students learn best when school can provide a range of varied experiences for them to try, test out and reflect. Post-pandemic, I hope to work with the staff of Bukit Timah Primary School to continue providing exciting and enriching learning experiences for all.

As an educator of more than 20 years’ experience, I have worked with a diverse student and staff profile. I started out as a secondary English Language and Business Studies teacher and thoroughly enjoyed this time supporting students’ academic learning and character growth. I helmed portfolios ranging from English Language to Innovation and Enterprise, and finally to Business Studies before embarking on school leadership.

As a Principal, I led East View Secondary School for 8 years before leaving for postgraduate studies at Teachers College, Columbia University. My experience as a secondary school leader strengthened my belief in education as a social leveller and that schools and teachers are critical in supporting young people as they grow, explore and define their identities and roles in the community. My postgraduate studies focused on supporting diversity in education, reading and the social impact of education. 

Upon returning from studies, I led Telok Kurau Primary School. This was my first stint working with younger students and I was amazed by their joy and eagerness to learn and experience school life, even with the pandemic restrictions. The experience taught me much about communicating with a younger student profile and I valued every interaction with them.

As I start my time in BTPS, I hope to get to know students, staff, parents and other stakeholders progressively over the year, so that I can understand the school culture and value-add as the school grows. In 2023, we look forward to the completion of the Indoor Sports Hall so that our students can have more space for their games and activities. Having celebrated the school’s 20th anniversary in 2022, BTPS also looks forward to strategizing for the future so that we continue to be “A school that fuels the hearts and minds to be future-ready”.
