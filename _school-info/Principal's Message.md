From the Principalâ€¦..

I believe all pupils have the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn. Learning can take place at any time and any place. Thus, it is important to create space and opportunities for learning to happen and allowing our pupils the time and space to experience and reflect upon their learning. Learning is a life-long journey and so the pupils must learn and want to take ownership of it.

At Bukit Timah Primary, we will continue to create opportunities and space for authentic learning experiences to take place for the pupils, enabling them to create their own experiences through the various programmes and learning opportunities make possible for them. We want our pupils to learn to think and reflect, developing both in character as well as metacognition to be an active contributor and concerned citizen.

Together with all staff, parents as well as the community, we build our school to be the place that fuels the hearts and minds of our pupils to be ready for the future.
