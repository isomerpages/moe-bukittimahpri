<h2>Our School Crest</h2>

<p align="justify">
The school crest is a human figure balancing an oscillating circle, against a golden peak. The human figure stands for a person robust in heart, mind and body and the circle, the academic and co-curricular excellence that every BTPS student will strive to achieve.</p>

The blue background symbolises depth of learning while gold represents the richness that will be experienced when the peak of excellence is attained.</p>
