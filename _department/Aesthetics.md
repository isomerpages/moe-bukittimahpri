As part of the school’s effort to recognise the talents of our pupils, we are proud to present P.A.M TV, a new programme starting in 2021!

P.A.M stands for PE, Art and Music. It will be aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays, during recess when the respective levels are having recess in class. BTPS pupils are encouraged to do a recording of their talents in any one of the areas related to PE, Art or Music.

**2021 Singapore Youth Festival: Art Exhibition**

<center>‘Art<em><strong>i</em></strong>st and Technology’</center>

<p class="tab">Technology has advanced and disrupted our lives. The 2021 exhibition theme “Artist and Technology” aims to highlight the artist’s role in utilising technology (past, present and future) to explore and express their views about how technology has shaped our lives.</p>

<p class="tab">This exhibition invites our student artists to reflect on how technology has impacted the various aspects of their lives, from the way they live to the way they work and play. Students will connect their lived experiences with technology, evaluate these phenomena through the lens of artist and audience, and create artistic artworks that express their ideas, imagination and reflections. As part of their artistic process, students will also learn to be safe and responsible users of technology and to harness the power of technology for positive purposes in their lives.</p>

# MUSIC FOR EVERYONE – BUILDING EMPATHY AND RESILIENCE
Bukit Timah Primary School strongly believes that music, being a universal language, will fuel the hearts and minds of its pupils so as to prepare them to be world-ready citizens.  To create a strong and vibrant school culture, the school has a diverse music programme that not only engages the pupils but empowers them with basic theoretical knowledge as well as exposure to individual and ensemble performances. 

Through *‘Music for Everyone!’*, we envision that every pupil will be able to:

*  Express himself/herself confidently through at least one of the performing arts: singing, dancing or playing one of the instruments introduced over the six years.
*  Inculcate creativity and thinking skills that inspire and nurture independent life-long learning.   
* To develop the values of **Empathy** and **Resilience** through different forms of Performing Arts    that  include singing, dancing and playing of instruments.

<p class="tab"><em>Through creating music, singing and playing instruments, students learn to express themselves creatively in different modes. Listening and appreciation skills enable them to respond and engage with new music throughout their lives. Music is an integral part of society. Hence learning music helps to enrich students&rsquo; social, cultural and historical awareness.</em></p>

<p class="tab"><em>Music Syllabus 2008</em></p>

Therefore, our mission is to develop our pupils in the five domains: Moral, Intellectual, Physical, Social & Moral as well as Aesthetics through music.  The school adopts the following school-wide ACE approach when designing the programme.

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **A**ppreciation | Appreciation of the environment, nature and the world through active learning process. |
| **C**reation | Creation of own learning |
| **E**xpression | Expressing of ones’ appreciation and creation. |

The school also aims to immerse the students in an enhanced music environment.  As pupils are young, many would like to explore and understand their own needs and talent. In their 6 years with Bukit Timah Primary School, they will establish their own interest and decide which area they would be pursuing as their life-long interest and be given opportunities to appreciate, create and express them.

# CHARMZ
**ChaRmz** is a school concert that happens once in every two years. It supports the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) – ***Music for Everyone*** by celebrating the young talents in the Visual and Performing Arts CCA groups and school music programmes. They include pupils from the BTPS Brass Symphonia, Show Choir, Dance-versity, Drama Club and Art Club.

**ChaRmz** provides opportunities for pupils to appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the diverse forms of music and visual arts. It also encourages pupils to interact and forge friendships with peers through music, dance and art, thus fostering social cohesion.

<center> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </center>


**ChaRmz** will be featured virtually on 12 July 2021 and the theme is “Everything is Awesome”. Not only is the school happy to invite representatives from the BTPS Parent Support Group (PSG) to put up a performance item, but the school would also like to bring some joy to the community by inviting them to watch the virtual concert in their respective venues.
