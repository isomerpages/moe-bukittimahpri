# Art
<p align="justify">
At BTPS, students learn Art through the four main elements of the learning content - context, artistic processes, media, and visual qualities. Every child learns to <b>see, express,</b> and <b>appreciate</b>. Our students’ creativity is fostered and stimulated through hands-on exploration of different art forms such as drawing, painting, sculpting and digital art. They also get an opportunity to experience a variety of traditional mediums such as Chinese Brush painting and Batik painting. 
Using the <i>Thinking Routines</i> is one of the approaches used to enhance students’ understanding and engagement with art. <i>"See-Think-Wonder"</i> encourages students to make careful observations and generate thoughtful questions, while <i>“Connect-Extend-Challenge"</i> prompts students to link their prior knowledge to new artistic concepts. </p>
