**2021 Singapore Youth Festival: Art Exhibition**

<center>‘Art<em><strong>i</em></strong>st and Technology’</center>

<p class="tab">Technology has advanced and disrupted our lives. The 2021 exhibition theme “Artist and Technology” aims to highlight the artist’s role in utilising technology (past, present and future) to explore and express their views about how technology has shaped our lives.</p>

<p class="tab">This exhibition invites our student artists to reflect on how technology has impacted the various aspects of their lives, from the way they live to the way they work and play. Students will connect their lived experiences with technology, evaluate these phenomena through the lens of artist and audience, and create artistic artworks that express their ideas, imagination and reflections. As part of their artistic process, students will also learn to be safe and responsible users of technology and to harness the power of technology for positive purposes in their lives.</p>

# MUSIC FOR EVERYONE – BUILDING EMPATHY AND RESILIENCE
Bukit Timah Primary School strongly believes that music, being a universal language, will fuel the hearts and minds of its pupils so as to prepare them to be world-ready citizens.  To create a strong and vibrant school culture, the school has a diverse music programme that not only engages the pupils but empowers them with basic theoretical knowledge as well as exposure to individual and ensemble performances. 

Through *‘Music for Everyone!’*, we envision that every pupil will be able to:

*  Express himself/herself confidently through at least one of the performing arts: singing, dancing or playing one of the instruments introduced over the six years.
*  Inculcate creativity and thinking skills that inspire and nurture independent life-long learning.   
* To develop the values of **Empathy** and **Resilience** through different forms of Performing Arts    that  include singing, dancing and playing of instruments.
