# SCIENCE

In BTPS, we treat that Every Child as an Inquirer of Science around us. Lessons are designed to allow pupils to construct their own understanding on various topics through inquiry and exploration. Hands-on experiments help them to connect concepts to life. Our Scheme of Work also caters for explicit teaching of skills such as Observation, Comparison, Classification, Graphing and Investigation.

 

**SAM (SCIENCE AROUND ME) JOURNAL**

SAM is a personalised journal that allows pupils to make their thinking visible and express themselves in their favourite style. Its main purpose is to actively support each child to take charge of his own learning. Creativity and curiosity are encouraged in the tasks set in SAM. Teachers use the journal to look out for pupils’ understanding and misconceptions. 

Through the journal, pupils get to:

* Pose questions
* Actively look for answers
* Explain their thinking
* Reflect on their learning
* Link what they have learnt to things around them

Thinking Routines are also used in the journal to help pupils to help the pupils form a deeper understanding of what they are learning and document their thinking the journal.

**SCIENCE IN THE LEARNING GARDEN @ BTPS**

Pupils observe a large variety of organisms to understand concepts in their life Science lessons – diversity, cycles, reproduction of plants and animals at the Learning Garden @ BTPS. Real-life data is collected for investigations making learning meaningful.

**INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT@BTPS)**

IOT@BTPS aims to bring about authentic, inquiry-based learning with sensors.  It involves connecting various sensors and having the data constantly being uploaded onto an online platform for data exchange and sharing. At BTPS, we make use of the authentic data collected from our own sensors as well as those from other schools in Singapore and UK to make our pupils more aware of the environment around them. Through the use of sensors, pupils also get to compare data over a longer period of time and link their learning to life.
