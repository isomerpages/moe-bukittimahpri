# Science

<p align="justify">At BTPS, we treat every pupil as an inquirer of Science. Our vision is ‘Curious Minds, Engaged Science Learners’. We believe that all pupils are curious about the world around us. We want to tap into this curiosity and engage them in the meaningful learning of Science. 
Through our lessons and programmes, we aim to develop our pupils into curious learners with the knowledge and skills to explore and understand the world around them. </p>


<b><u>Through our Science programme, BTPS pupils will: </u></b><p style="justify">
•	 Construct their own understanding about Science topics.<br>
•	 Connect scientific concepts to daily living and decision making.<br>
• 	Demonstrate “Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science” through Investigating, Evaluating, Reasoning and Developing and Evaluating Solutions. <br>
•	 Develop the character strength of Resilience.</p>

<p align="justify">
Through the SAM journal, our pupils form a deeper understanding of what they learn and develop skills of critical thinking. It is essential that pupils do not become proficient ‘regurgitators’ of information but rather individuals capable of applying, innovating and constructing new knowledge from what they have learnt.</p>

<u>**Our Key Programmes**</u>
<p align="justify">
SAM JOURNAL (CREATIVE EXPRESSIONS OF LEARNING)
Journaling allows pupils to make their thinking visible and express themselves in their preferred styles. Through the SAM (Science Around Me) journal, we actively support each child to take charge of their own learning. Journaling tasks can take on different forms, including poster design, investigative experiment, observation record, mind map generation and the application of Thinking Routines (TR).  </p>

<u>**The use of Thinking Routines challenges our pupils to:**</u>

• 	Reflect and pose questions about their learning. <br>
• 	Actively look for answers in their observations. <br>
• 	Explain and rationalise their thinking.<br>
• 	Link their learning to the world around them. <br>
