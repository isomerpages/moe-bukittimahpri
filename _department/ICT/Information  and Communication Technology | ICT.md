# INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ( ICT )

<p align="justify">
Our school’s ICT literacy programme is built on MOE’s standards of new media literacy and includes the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values (SKAV) that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing ICT for learning and interacting. The new ICT baseline standards are: curating digital content; connecting and communicating digitally; and creating digital multimodal products. </p><p align="justify">

Our ICT programmes across P1 to P6 aims to equip every student with the fundamental ICT skills and literacy to be a future-ready individual and be competent in New Media Literacies to navigate the cyber world safely and effectively. Through the introduction of computational thinking and the infusion of new media literacies into different disciplines, we hope to achieve the following objectives-</p><h3>Students will be able to:</h3>
1. Acquire and apply technical skills to create digital content<br>
2. Demonstrate 21st CC through self-directed and collaborative learning<br>
3. Develop computational thinking and problem-solving skills
