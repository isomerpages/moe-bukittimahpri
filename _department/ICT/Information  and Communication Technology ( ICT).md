<p align="justify"><strong>Overview:</strong><br>At Bukit Timah Primary School, our ICT Digital Literacy programme prepares students to be adaptive learners, empathetic leaders, and future-ready citizens. Students use technology to explore ideas, collaborate with peers, and create digital products, while developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and cyber wellness skills. By combining digital literacy with computational thinking, our programme helps students learn independently, engage responsibly online, and apply technology meaningfully. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Department mission:</strong><br>
To design learning experiences where students think critically and adaptively, learn responsibly and collaboratively, and teachers use technology to guide, personalise, and deepen learning.
</p>

<strong>Objectives:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Develop students’ confidence and competence in using technology as a tool for learning across subjects. </li>
<li>Strengthen critical thinking, creative problem-solving, and purposeful digital design through inquiry-based experiences. </li>
<li>Cultivate responsible digital habits, ethical decision-making, and respectful online collaboration. </li>
<li>Provide authentic learning opportunities that foster independence, empathy, and adaptability in a digital environment. </li>
<li>
Prepare students to apply digital skills meaningfully in everyday life as future-ready and reflective learners. </li>
</ul>

<tr><td><p align="justify">Our whole-school Digital Literacy Curriculum provides a coherent and progressive framework that develops the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values students need to navigate an increasingly digital world. Across levels, students learn to create and use digital content, collaborate effectively, and apply computational thinking to real-world challenges. </p>
<p align="justify">
Students from P1 to P6: <br>
1.  Create and use digital content across various tools and platforms.<br>
2.  Learn independently and collaboratively,&nbsp;demonstrating&nbsp;21st-century skills.<br> 
3.  Apply computational thinking and problem-solving to real-world challenges.</p>

<p align="justify"><font color="#4b0082">Code the Future (CTF)</font><br>
As part of our school’s Digital Literacy Curriculum, Code the Future (CTF) introduces coding through a structured spiral progression, ensuring students build digital competencies in an&nbsp;age-appropriate ;and meaningful way. Each stage of learning is aligned to a key programme theme: Explore &amp; Code, Design &amp; Code, and Innovate &amp; Code.</p>

<tr><td><p align="justify">Technology is intentionally embedded within the school’s Inquiry-Based Learning supported by Thinking Routines to enhance classroom learning across subjects. Digital tools are used to help students explore ideas, make their thin ing visible, collaborate with others, and reflect on their learning processes.  </p>
<p align="justify">
By applying technology in authentic contexts such as communicating ideas, analysing information, simulating scenarios, and creating multimodal representations, students deepen understanding while strengthening critical thinking and communication skills. These experiences nurture responsible and adaptable digital learners who can transfer their skills across disciplines and contexts. </p>
