# INFORMATION  AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY(ICT)

In order to fuel our studentsâ€™ minds, we use ICT to develop knowledge through subject mastery, thinking routines and skills through 21st Century Competencies. Together with our character building programme, we also included cyber wellness lessons and programmes to help our pupils to become responsible digital learners.

***BTPS Integration of ICT  into Curriculum***

**1. Baseline ICT and New Media Literacies Programmes**

New Media Literacies are defined as the competencies to create, connect and curate information in the digital networked environment. Acquiring competency in these will enable students to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the Web and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate and participate productively. These lessons are integrated in the curriculum to facilitate teaching and learning. Our pupils learn basic level of knowledge, skills and values in the lessons.
