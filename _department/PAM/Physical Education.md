<h4><strong>Physical Education</strong></h4><br>
<p align="justify"><strong>Overview of PAM:</strong><br>
Through Physical Education (PE), students develop healthy habits, confidence in movement, and a positive relationship with physical activity. Through structured lessons and purposeful play, they learn to care for their bodies, move safely, and make informed choices that support their overall well-being.</p>
<p align="justify">
Across the levels, PE focuses on building strong movement foundations while encouraging students to challenge themselves at an appropriate pace. Learning experiences are thoughtfully designed to cater to diverse abilities, ensuring that every child feels supported, included, and confident to participate, regardless of their starting point.</p>

Through games, challenges, and team activities, students develop collaboration skills, empathy, and resilience. They are encouraged to think critically, reflect on their learning, and problem-solve as they improve, growing into confident, caring, and active individuals.</p>
