<h4><strong>Physical Education</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">Through Physical Education (PE), students develop healthy habits, confidence in movement, and a positive relationship with physical activity. Through structured lessons and purposeful play, they learn to care for their bodies, move safely, and make informed choices that support their overall well-being.</p>
<p align="justify">
Across the levels, PE focuses on building strong movement foundations while encouraging students to challenge themselves at an appropriate pace. Learning experiences are thoughtfully designed to cater to diverse abilities, ensuring that every child feels supported, included, and confident to participate, regardless of their starting point.</p>
<p align="justify">
Through games, challenges, and team activities, students develop collaboration skills, empathy, and resilience. They are encouraged to think critically, reflect on their learning, and problem-solve as they improve, growing into confident, caring, and active individuals.</p>

<tbody><tr><td style="background-color: #7C71AD;"><strong><font color="#ffffff">Healthy Living Programme </font></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align="justify">Under the Healthy Living Programme, students are supported through year-round initiatives that promote safe habits and a meaningful understanding of healthy living. One such initiative is the Zero Accident Campaign, which helps students recognise hazards, practise safe movement, and take responsibility for their own well-being, and then extending that care to others.</p>
<p align="justify">
Learning is further enriched through authentic experiences embedded in school-wide events such as International Friendship Day. Through an SEA Games–themed element, students gain insights into how athletes from different countries live with discipline, from training routines to daily nutrition.</p>
<p align="justify">
Collectively, these experiences enable students to internalise healthy and responsible habits while developing care and concern for those around them, aligning strongly with our vision of nurturing Empathetic Leaders.</p>

<tr><td><p align="justify">In 2025, BTPS refreshed the traditional NAPFA experience by gamifying the assessment to better align with our vision of nurturing Future-Ready Citizens. While NAPFA has long served as a benchmark for physical fitness, the focus was intentionally shifted from performance alone to a more student-centered experience that builds motivation, confidence, and enjoyment.</p>
<p align="justify">
Through level-wide challenges, achievement milestones, and positive competition, students were more engaged and willing to challenge themselves at each station. The impact was evident—higher participation, greater perseverance, and fewer students giving up when tasks became challenging—demonstrating that fitness can be both meaningful and enjoyable for all learners.</p>

<tr><td><p align="justify">The BTPS Games Carnival, held annually on the eve of Children’s Day, is both a joyful celebration and a meaningful milestone for students. Beyond the festivities, it provides every child with opportunities to showcase the skills, strategies, and concepts learnt throughout the year.</p>
<p align="justify">
From station games that highlight fundamental movement skills to inter-class games that apply more complex game concepts, the carnival offers purposeful progression across all levels. Age-appropriate activities ensure fairness, engagement, and success for every student.</p>
<p align="justify">
Aligned with our vision of nurturing Adaptive Learners, the Games Carnival encourages students to think on their feet, respond to challenges, collaborate with teammates, and confidently apply their learning in a lively and supportive environment.</p>
