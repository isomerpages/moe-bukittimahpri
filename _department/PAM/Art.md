<p>&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Through Physical Education (PE), students develop
healthy habits, confidence in movement, and a positive relationship with
physical activity. Through structured lessons and purposeful play, they
learn to care for their bodies, move safely, and make informed choices
that support their overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>Across the levels, PE focuses on building strong movement foundations
while encouraging students to challenge themselves at an appropriate pace.
Learning experiences are thoughtfully designed to cater to diverse abilities,
ensuring that every child feels supported, included, and confident to participate,
regardless of their starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>Through games, challenges, and team activities, students develop collaboration
skills, empathy, and resilience. They are encouraged to think critically,
reflect on their learning, and problem-solve as they improve, growing into
confident, caring, and active individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color="#4b0082"&gt;Key Programmes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;table&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="background-color: #7C71AD;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font
color="#ffffff"&gt;Healthy Living Programme &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;Under the Healthy Living
Programme, students are supported through year-round initiatives that promote
safe habits and a meaningful understanding of healthy living. One such
initiative is the Zero Accident Campaign, which helps students recognise
hazards, practise safe movement, and take responsibility for their own
well-being, and then extending that care to others.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>Learning is further enriched through authentic experiences embedded in
school-wide events such as International Friendship Day. Through an SEA
Games–themed element, students gain insights into how athletes from different
countries live with discipline, from training routines to daily nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>Collectively, these experiences enable students to internalise healthy
and responsible habits while developing care and concern for those around
them, aligning strongly with our vision of nurturing Empathetic Leaders.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="background-color: #f48470;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font
color="#ffffff"&gt;Gamification of NAPFA &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;In 2025, BTPS refreshed the
traditional NAPFA experience by gamifying the assessment to better align
with our vision of nurturing Future-Ready Citizens. While NAPFA has long
served as a benchmark for physical fitness, the focus was intentionally
shifted from performance alone to a more student-centered experience that
builds motivation, confidence, and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>Through level-wide challenges, achievement milestones, and positive competition,
students were more engaged and willing to challenge themselves at each
station. The impact was evident—higher participation, greater perseverance,
and fewer students giving up when tasks became challenging—demonstrating
that fitness can be both meaningful and enjoyable for all learners.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="background-color: #74cdd7;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font
color="#ffffff"&gt;Games Carnival X Inter- Class Games &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The BTPS Games Carnival,
held annually on the eve of Children’s Day, is both a joyful celebration
and a meaningful milestone for students. Beyond the festivities, it provides
every child with opportunities to showcase the skills, strategies, and
concepts learnt throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>From station games that highlight fundamental movement skills to inter-class
games that apply more complex game concepts, the carnival offers purposeful
progression across all levels. Age-appropriate activities ensure fairness,
engagement, and success for every student.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p align="justify"&gt;</p>
<p>Aligned with our vision of nurturing Adaptive Learners, the Games Carnival
encourages students to think on their feet, respond to challenges, collaborate
with teammates, and confidently apply their learning in a lively and supportive
environment.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</p>
