<h4><strong>Music (Learning for Life Programme)</strong></h4>
<p align="justify">Through the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Music for Everyone: Building Empathy and Resilience, students experience music as a meaningful part of school life that supports their social, emotional, and personal development.

Through singing, movement, and instrumental learning, students explore and express ideas using their voices and instruments. Music lessons encourage careful listening, experimentation with sound, and collaboration as students perform, create, and respond to music. These shared experiences help students build confidence, creativity, and musical understanding, while learning to work together and appreciate different perspectives.

Beyond the classroom, our LLP provides authentic opportunities for students to experience music in varied settings. These include performing for different groups within the school community and making music together with peers and seniors through community and intergenerational experiences. Over their years in school, students develop empathy and resilience through making music together, while discovering their interests and forming a lasting connection with the performing arts.
