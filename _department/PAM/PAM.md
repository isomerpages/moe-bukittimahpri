<strong>Overview of PAM:</strong>
<p align="justify">The PAM Department supports the holistic development of every child at Bukit Timah Primary School. Through purposeful learning experiences in Physical Education, Art and Music, students build confidence, character, and a positive disposition towards learning.</p>
