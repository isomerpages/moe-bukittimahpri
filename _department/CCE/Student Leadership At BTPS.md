<h3>Student Leadership: Cultivating Future-Ready Leaders of Character</h3><p>At BTPS, our Student Leadership programme is designed to foster a community that champions prosocial behaviors and cultivates positive relationships among students. Guided by "The Student Leadership Challenge" by Posner &amp; Kouzes, our three-tiered approach empowers students to become leaders of character.<br>We believe that every student at BTPS possesses innate leadership qualities, beginning with leading themselves, then their peers, and ultimately the community. Our Student Leadership framework is structured into three tiers, starting with Classroom Leaders.</p><h3>Leadership Opportunities</h3><p>In the first tier, students assume class leadership positions and are given the opportunity to serve their classmates. They engage in in-class training sessions that center around the five exemplary leadership practices outlined in the Student Leadership Challenge.<br>At Tiers 2 and 3, our Student Leaders are entrusted with the responsibility of actively contributing to both the school and the wider community. They play an integral role in planning and executing various events, such as Teacher’s Day Celebrations and NE Events, while also engaging in service roles like Junior First Aiders and Peer Support Ambassadors.<br>Our aim is to nurture well-rounded leaders of character who not only demonstrate effective leadership but also make meaningful contributions to our school community and beyond. These initiatives aim to instill a sense of responsibility and civic mindedness in our students, empowering them to positively impact the world around them.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Students%20Activities%20Photos/SLD_framework_2.png"></div><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="5"><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Students Activities Photos/SLD_photos.png"></div></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher’s Day Celebration</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Student Leader’s Investiture</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Student Leadership Training</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Peer Support Relationship | PSR</h1><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="border:2px solid #0A0B30; width:400px;height:300px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/CCE4.jpeg"></div><p><br></p><p>A strong Peer Support culture enables our students develop resilience as they give or seek support from peers or trusted adults in school. Our school adopts a two-tiered approach <strong>(Tier 1: Everyone is a Peer Supporter and Tier 2: Peer Support Ambassadors)</strong>, to strengthen the peer support relationships (PSR) among peers, as well as to foster a culture of care and inclusiveness within the school.</p><p><strong><u>Tier 1: Everyone is a peer supporter</u></strong><br></p><p>To allow everyone to be a peer supporter, the “CHEER” model adapted from Guidance Branch is introduced as part of the Peer Support Curriculum.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="border:2px solid #0A0B30; width:400px;height:300px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce005.jpg"></div><p><br></p><p>BTPS students use the CHEER Model to help classmates who need social and emotional support. They also undergo experiential activities to understand and appreciate the importance of Peer Support during the Back-to-School programme.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="border:2px solid #0A0B30; width:360px;height:200px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce006.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="border:2px solid #0A0B30; width:360px;height:200px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/cce007.jpg"></div><p><br><strong><u>Tier 2: Peer Support Ambassadors (PSAs)</u></strong><br></p><p>Peer Support Ambassadors (PSAs) were appointed to support peers socially and emotionally, therefore promoting overall student well-being and strengthening the positive network of peers in the school. This contributes to a caring and positive learning environment.</p><p></p><p>To develop an effective Peer Support culture within the school, PSAs@BTPS were selected for their sense of empathy and moral courage and are trained in interpersonal skills to positively influence and support their peers. They are also taught to recognise signs of distress and offer practical help or seek support for their peers. </p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Students Activities Photos/psa2.png"></div><p><br></p>
