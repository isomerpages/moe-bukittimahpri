<strong>Bukit Timah Primary School (BTPS) aims to develop every student to be a leader of character, who has the will to act and serve his/her school and community.</strong>

<strong>As the school believes that every student has the potential to be a leader and some students have potential to develop stronger leadership qualities, the school’s three-tiered framework anchors all students to Self-Leadership, and introduces Peer Leadership and School Leadership for selected students.</strong>

<strong>Based on the five leadership practices of The Student Leadership Challenge, our school-wide training programme develops our students into leaders anchored in values and strong social emotional competencies, and offers opportunities for them to develop their leadership qualities by contributing back to their school or the community.</strong>

<strong>With these intentional efforts, the BTPS student leader eventually becomes a Leader of Character, who contributes back to the community.</strong>

# Our Values-based Approach

Hence, the school adopts The Student Leadership Challenge model and introduces the five practices as part of our school student leadership development.</center></strong>


# Peer Support Relationship | PSR


<img src="/images/CCE4.jpeg" style="border:2px solid #0A0B30; width:400px;height:300px;"><p align="justify">A strong Peer Support culture enables our students develop resilience as they give or seek support from peers or trusted adults in school. Our school adopts a two-tiered approach <strong>(Tier 1: Everyone is a Peer Supporter and Tier 2: Peer Support Ambassadors)</strong>, to strengthen the peer support relationships (PSR) among peers, as well as to foster a culture of care and inclusiveness within the school.</p><strong><u>Tier 1: Everyone is a peer supporter</u></strong><br>
<p align="justify">
To allow everyone to be a peer supporter, the “CHEER” model adapted from Guidance Branch is introduced as part of the Peer Support Curriculum. </p>
<img src="/images/cce005.jpg" style="border:2px solid #0A0B30; width:400px;height:300px;"><p align="justify">BTPS students use the CHEER Model to help classmates who need social and emotional support. They also undergo experiential activities to understand and appreciate the importance of Peer Support during the Back-to-School programme.</p>

Peer Support Ambassadors (PSAs) were appointed to support peers socially and emotionally, therefore promoting overall student well-being and strengthening the positive network of peers in the school. This contributes to a caring and positive learning environment.
To develop an effective Peer Support culture within the school, PSAs@BTPS were selected for their sense of empathy and moral courage and are trained in interpersonal skills to positively influence and support their peers. They are also taught to recognise signs of distress and offer practical help or seek support for their peers.</p>
