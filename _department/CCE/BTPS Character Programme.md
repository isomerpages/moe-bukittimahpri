# BTPS CHARACTER PROGRAMME

The school emphasises Character and Leadership Development through the teaching of School Values, Social Emotional Learning competencies and leadership skills. Positive Psychology is used to build confidence in our pupils by focusing on their character strengths.

A theme-based assembly programme, P3-P4 camps, leadership camps, weekly CCAs and Form Teacher Guidance Period lessons provide opportunities to build character and leadership skills.

Students apply their learning in service projects in class, school, at home and in the community through outreach projects at the Kindergartens and activity centres for the elderly.
