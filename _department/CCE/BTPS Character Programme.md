<strong>Enactment of CCE</strong> <br>
In the enactment of CCE2021 curriculum, we value student-centricity, intentionality and coherence when designing learning experiences such as Book-Free Day to support student well-being and ignite the joy of learning.  <br><br>
<strong>Book-Free Day ‘(Re)Discovering Myself’ </strong><br>
Based on the Reflective Practice Model of asking ‘what’, ‘why’, ‘so what’ and ‘now what’, this pedagogical approach shaped students’ learning experiences over the two days, as they went through a cycle involving experiencing, reflecting, thinking and acting to transform their experiences into learning.

<strong>Student Well-Being </strong><br>
From classroom activities such as Back-to-School activities to check in on student well-being, to promoting inclusivity and involving student leaders as peer supporters in school-wide programmes, students are equipped with the necessary skills and provided with support to overcome challenges and seek help from others. <br>
