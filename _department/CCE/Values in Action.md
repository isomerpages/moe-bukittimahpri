# VALUES IN ACTION

The Values-In-Action (VIA) programme aims to nurture community builders through empowerment and engagement, and in BTPS, pupils are empowered through “Value Self, Value Others” initiative to enhance the well-being of self and others in the community.

Through progressive learning experiences, our pupils show concern to others and look beyond their own interests to those of others in the family, school, community, nation and offer their time and effort to serve the community.

The table below lists the VIA programmes in BTPS.
