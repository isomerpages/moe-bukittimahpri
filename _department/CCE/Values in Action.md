<h1>Values-in-Action: Fostering Socially Responsible Citizens</h1><p>At BTPS, our Values in Action (VIA) framework aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who make meaningful contributions to their families, friends, school, and the wider community. Our three-tiered approach is designed to facilitate age-appropriate learning and practical application of values, knowledge, and skills. <br>This structured framework enables students to not only understand but also embody values that are fundamental to creating a positive impact in the lives of others. We believe it is crucial to prioritize self-worth before extending that value to others. That's why our younger students start by appreciating themselves first, before learning to show kindness and care to their classmates and family.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Students%20Activities%20Photos/via1.png"></div></th><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p>Our middle primary pupils celebrate Chinese New Year with the residents of Eng Kong Cheng Soon.
