# Values-in-Action: Fostering Socially Responsible Citizens

<p align="justify">
At BTPS, our Values in Action (VIA) framework aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who make meaningful contributions to their families, friends, school, and the wider community. Our three-tiered approach is designed to facilitate age-appropriate learning and practical application of values, knowledge, and skills. <br>
This structured framework enables students to not only understand but also embody values that are fundamental to creating a positive impact in the lives of others.
We believe it is crucial to prioritize self-worth before extending that value to others. That's why our younger students start by appreciating themselves first, before learning to show kindness and care to their classmates and family.</p>
