<h3>NATIONAL EDUCATION</h3>
<p align="justify">
Our national education curriculum provides students with the knowledge, skills and values to understand Singapore’s history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, support sense-making and develop critical thinking skills such that students are socially aware and informed about local, regional and global issues. 
</p><h3>Total Defence Day </h3><p align="justify">
Students gain a deeper appreciation of the various defences that keep Singapore strong and resilient, as they reflect and put into action how they could contribute to the unity and resilience, regardless of their age or station in life. </p>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL FRIENDSHIP DAY </h3> 
<p align="justify">
Asia is the world’s fastest-growing region, and Singapore continues to facilitate closer economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and in Asia. Through International Friendship Day (IFD), students understand Singapore’s realities as a small state and ASEAN’s diversity and seek ways to promote the spirit of friendship, thereby promoting collaboration in this diverse and vibrant region of the world. </p>
<p align="justify">
Drawing upon the diverse cultural backgrounds and nationalities in our school population, our Parent Support Group has been instrumental in putting up elaborate and engaging exhibitions, performances and activities to promote understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures in our students. It is noteworthy that in the past few years, we have featured many countries such as Indonesia, India, Canada, Holland, Germany, Spain, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Korea, Australia and etc. in the IFD showcase.</p><center><img src="/images/School%20Photos/Highlights_from_past_IFD_exhibitions.png" style="width:100%"><b>

<h3>RACIAL HARMONY DAY </h3>
<p align="justify">Schools commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21st July. On this day in 1964, Singapore saw racial riots. Racial Harmony Day serves to remind us that social division costs us dearly and that race and religion are potential fault-lines in the Singapore society. It is a day for students to reflect on, and celebrate our success as a harmonious nation and society built on a rich diversity of cultures and heritages. .</p>

<h3>NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATION</h3>
<p align="justify">
National Day marks our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1997, NE Show has been organised for the Primary 5 pupils to instill a sense of pride and belonging in students and to bring across the significance of our National Day. The ceremony aims to bring to the pupils a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.

In celebration of the schools’ BTPS Inspire programme, BTPS celebrates National Day with level showcases of students’ hopes and dreams for Singapore and our future. </p>
