National Education (NE) is about engaging the hearts and minds of pupils in developing a shared sense of identity.

Through core NE commemorative days and programmes pupils develop a sense of belonging and commitment to the school, community, nation and world.

**TOTAL DEFENCE DAY**

Total Defence Day marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942 on 15 February. This poignant day involves every resident in Singapore playing a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong and cohesive nation that is well prepared for any situation. Total Defence remains relevant because the threats faced today require all Singaporeans to step up and play their part.

On this day, our pupils gain a deeper appreciation of the various defences that keep Singapore strong and resilient, as they reflect and put into action how they could contribute to the unity and resilience of the people.
