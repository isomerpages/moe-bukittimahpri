# INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY | ICT

<p align="justify">
Our school’s ICT literacy programme is built on MOE’s standards of new media literacy and includes the skills, knowledge, attitudes and values (SKAV) that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing ICT for learning and interacting. The new ICT baseline standards are: curating digital content; connecting and communicating digitally; and creating digital multimodal products. </p>

<p align="justify">
Our ICT programmes across P1 to P6 aims to equip every student with the fundamental ICT skills and literacy to be a future-ready individual and be competent in New Media Literacies to navigate the cyber world safely and effectively. Through the introduction of computational thinking and the infusion of new media literacies into different disciplines, we hope to achieve the following objectives- </p>


 <strong>Students will be able to:</strong><br>
1. Acquire and apply technical skills to create digital content<br>
2. Demonstrate 21st CC through self-directed and collaborative learning!<br>
3. Develop computational thinking and problem-solving skills

<u><strong>Info-comm CCA</strong></u><br>
The Info-Comm Club offers its members an exciting journey into Digital Making and Immersive Media. Under the guidance of its trainers, pupils will gain an understanding on Microsoft Makecode, Microbit, and learn the fundamentals of mobile photography, videography creating podcasts and Augmented Reality (AR) video content.</p>

<u><strong>Competitions</strong></u><br>
Through the application of computational thinking and design thinking constructs, a team of  pupils learn how to problem solve and use upcycled materials such as cardboard, infused with technology, to create useful artefacts. They participate in the Pei Hwa Hackathon 2023 on the 27 May 2023. They came up with a project on automated plant watering system for people who travel frequently or the elderly with dementia and might forget to water their plants.

Another team of pupils participated in the IDE Code Builder 2023 on 9 May 2023 where they applied their Scratch 3.0 coding skills based on a series of computing-based questions.</p>
