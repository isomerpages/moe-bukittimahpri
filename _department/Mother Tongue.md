We aim to cultivate student’s appreciation of their Mother Tongue languages through positive experiences.  For the third year in a row, our school has participated in the Goodtalk "Global Village" Children & Youth Bilingual Speech Convention. 

This competition cum convention is a semi-official activity organised by China in collaboration with countries like Australia, the United States, Denmark, Japan and Singapore.
