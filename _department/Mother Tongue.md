<h3><u>Our Vision</u></h3><p align="justify">
The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department strives to develop BTPS students to become confident communicators and active learners of MTL, who are effectively bilingual and rooted in traditional culture.</p>

<h3><u>Our Mission</u></h3><p align="justify">
Our mission is to enthuse pupils through fun and engaging teaching pedagogies while learning Mother Tongue.</p>

<h3><u>Our Belief</u></h3><p align="justify">
We believe that every child can learn. The BTPS MT teachers sees every BTPS pupil as a flower bud. They will all bloom but at their own pace. Our role as teachers is to nurture each bud patiently and diligently so that they will blossom eventually.</p>


<h2>Key Programmes</h2>

<p align="justify">We aim to build a strong foundation and nurture the love of Mother Tongue in our students through reading. Our Reading Programme includes “Visit the Library”, “School Based Reading Activities” and “SLS Reading Mums &amp; Dads”. Every year, students will be introduced to the new books in the school library collection. </p><p></p>

<p align="jusitfy">“SLS Reading Mums &amp; Dads” is a collaboration between parents and teachers where our supportive Reading Mums and Reading Dads will read Chinese story books to our students online. Teachers will create online activities like Kahoot and Drawing to further stimulate the interest of our students.</p>
<b><h3><u>World Book Day</u></h3></b>
<p align="justify">In conjunction with World Book Day, we organised a series of activities to encourage our students to discover the pleasure of reading. Activities include visiting the MOLLY bus by National Library Board, picture book introduction and presentation by a renowned local author and performances put up by teachers. Students engage in classroom activities to create their own books and Malay students get to dress up as their favourite characters from the book. Our school also hosted a book fair from a local publisher. </p>
