<h1>MOTHER TONGUE DEPARTMENT</h1><br>

<h3><u>Our Vision</u></h3><p align="justify">
The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department strives to develop BTPS students to become confident communicators and active learners of MTL, who are effectively bilingual and rooted in traditional culture.</p>

<h3><u>Our Mission</u></h3><p align="justify">
Our mission is to enthuse pupils through fun and engaging teaching pedagogies while learning Mother Tongue.</p>

<h3><u>Our Belief</u></h3><p align="justify">
We believe that every child can learn. The BTPS MT teachers sees every BTPS pupil as a flower bud. They will all bloom but at their own pace. Our role as teachers is to nurture each bud patiently and diligently so that they will blossom eventually.</p>


<h2>Key Programmes</h2>

<p align="justify">We aim to build a strong foundation and nurture the love of Mother Tongue in our students through reading. Our Reading Programme includes “Visit the Library”, “School Based Reading Activities” and “SLS Reading Mums &amp; Dads”. Every year, students will be introduced to the new books in the school library collection. </p><p></p>
