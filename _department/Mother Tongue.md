<h3><u>Our Vision</u></h3><p align="justify">
The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department strives to develop BTPS students to become confident communicators and active learners of MTL, who are effectively bilingual and rooted in traditional culture.</p>

<h3><u>Our Mission</u></h3><p align="justify">
Our mission is to enthuse pupils through fun and engaging teaching pedagogies while learning Mother Tongue.</p>

<h3><u>Our Belief</u></h3><p align="justify">
We believe that every child can learn. The BTPS MT teachers sees every BTPS pupil as a flower bud. They will all bloom but at their own pace. Our role as teachers is to nurture each bud patiently and diligently so that they will blossom eventually.</p>

Activities include visiting the MOLLY bus by National Library Board, picture book introduction and presentation by a renowned local author and performances put up by teachers.

<h3><u>Pongalo Pongal 2023</u></h3>
<p align="justify">In conjunction with the celebration of the harvest festival by Tamil commmunity, Pongal our Tamil pupils took part in “Pongalo Pongal 2023” - a series of competitions for primary school Tamil pupils organised by Mediacorp Seithi.
 </p>
<p align="justify">Dhakshanya from 5 Compassion took part in the competition. As part of the competition, she wrote a letter to a friend sharing information about Pongal. Her y  won the Top 6 entries nationwide and was published on the Mediacorp Seithi’s website. Dhakshanya  wrote about the four days of Pongal celebration, namely ‘Bhogi’ (when old things in the house are disposed by burning), ‘Surya Pongal’ (when Pongal rice is cooked in a pot. As it boils over, the celebrants shout ‘Pongalo Pongal’ representing the ushering in of new beginnings and blessings), ‘Maattu Pongal’ (when cows are revered and honoured for their role in farming) and ‘Kaanum Pongal’ (when relatives visit each other and receive blessings from their elders). Her drawing of sugarcanes and the Pongal pot at the end of the letter enhanced her written entry. </p>
