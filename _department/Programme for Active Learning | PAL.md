# PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL)
<p align="justify">
<strong>Programme for Active Learning (PAL)</strong> is one of Primary Education Review and Implementation’s (PERI) recommendations to focus on holistic education and development of life skills. It provides a smooth transition for children from pre-school to primary school. </p>

<strong>PAL @ BTPS</strong> is a series of activities specially planned for Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils. These lessons take place for 8 weeks in a term.

<p align="justify">
<strong>PAL @ BTPS</strong> aims to develop pupils in Social Emotional Learning (SEL) and values. Pupils will go through various learning experiences based on the Appreciation, Creation and Express (ACE) approach. The ACE approach develops pupils with the ability to appreciate arts and nature, the confidence to be expressive and creativity in problem solving. </p>

<strong> Performing Arts – Music and Movement</strong> <br>
Performing Arts in PAL aims to promote the all-rounded development of pupils in Aesthetics. It provides a platform for pupils to learn about World Music Cultures and improvise dance moves they observe from each cultural dance, eventually contributing ideas towards a class performance at the end of the programme. The performance celebrates the pupils’ success in the domain as they contribute to the choreography of the performance.
