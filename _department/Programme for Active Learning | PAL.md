<strong> <u>Performing Arts – Music and Movement</u></strong> <br>
Performing Arts in PAL aims to promote the all-rounded development of pupils in Aesthetics. It provides a platform for pupils to learn about World Music Cultures and improvise dance moves they observe from each cultural dance, eventually contributing ideas towards a class performance at the end of the programme. The performance celebrates the pupils’ success in the domain as they contribute to the choreography of the performance.

<strong><u>Outdoor Education</u></strong><br>
Outdoor Education (OE) in PAL grows pupil’s appreciation of the environment and nature while working together towards a common goal. It includes activities such as nature walks, outdoor play, navigation and team building. Pupils are engaged in experiential learning which develops physical, socioemotional, and cognitive skills while building positive relationships with their peers and with nature. P also learn about sustainability and conservation through OE.  </p>

<strong><u>Visual Arts</u></strong><br>
This is an innovative approach to teach visual arts to students which engages them in active learning. 
<p align="justify">
The programme is based on the philosophy that visual arts are not just a set of skills, but a way of thinking, communicating, and understanding the world. It is structured around a series of hands-on, interactive, and collaborative activities and projects.  </p>

<p align="justify">
Visual Arts in PAL emphasises the process of creating art over the end product, encouraging students to experiment, take risks, and learn from their mistakes. Pupils are encouraged to reflect on their work and the work of others, and to use feedback and critique to improve their skills and understanding.

<strong><u>Games and Sports</u></strong><br>
The BTPS PAL Games and Sports domain aims to develop problem solving skills and teamwork in every pupil. Pupils think critically and creatively to reach workable solutions with their peers. These experiences develop our pupils to become adaptable and resilient individuals. </p>
