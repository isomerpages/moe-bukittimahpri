**Our Programmes:**

# I) JOURNALING TO ENHANCE LEARNING OF ENGLISH

***a. English Language Learning Experiences (ELLE) for P1 and P2 pupils***

ELLE is a journal that gives pupils space and opportunities to realise that learning English is a fun experience.   ELLE allows   them to express their thoughts, their likes, dislikes, and feelings about every day experiences as well as their readings. Moreover,  journaling provides our young ones opportunities to use   Thinking Routines to link their learning to deepen their understanding of school values and social & emotional competencies.

***b.Tackling English Diligently (TED) for P3 to P6 pupils***

TED provides pupils the platform to explore the different aspects of learning English and make it a fun and exciting experience.   TED allows pupils to journal their thoughts, their views/opinions, likes and dislikes via the use of the Thinking Routines.  This journaling experience provides our pupils with opportunities to read the nuances between lines and go beyond the text.  Journaling opens the doors for them to make connections to school values, the social and emotional learning competencies while enjoying the enriching language learning experiences.

Pupils enjoy challenging one another in     this word game which help develop thinking skills, build vocabulary and put values, such as respect, integrity and graciousness into practice.  Our pupils have attained awards at both National and Zonal levels but above winning awards, are the rich bonds of friendship they develop with the players from other schools as well within our own school.



# IV) SUPER JOURNALING TEAM (SJT)

The Super Journaling is a special programme designed for pupils who are self-directed and love journaling. Their TED entries, which include reflection of articles, showcases their deep thinking. SJT members who are selected based on their interest in journaling and writing, would attend master classes which are conducted outside curriculum hours once every term.

They get opportunities to explore issues and topics from different perspectives with supporting evidences and reasoning.  Their learning experiences are varied which include meeting a baker, a national soccer player and even exploring our neighbourhood gardens.  The collaborative work by SJT pupils together with the Art Club members help create beautiful poems with wonderful artistic illustrations.
