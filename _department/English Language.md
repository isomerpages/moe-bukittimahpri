**Our Programmes:**

**1) JOURNALING TO ENHANCE LEARNING OF ENGLISH**

***a. English Language Learning Experiences (ELLE) for P1 and P2 pupils***

ELLE is a journal that gives pupils space and opportunities to realise that learning English is a fun experience.   ELLE allows   them to express their thoughts, their likes, dislikes, and feelings about every day experiences as well as their readings. Moreover,  journaling provides our young ones opportunities to use   Thinking Routines to link their learning to deepen their understanding of school values and social & emotional competencies.

***b.Tackling English Diligently (TED) for P3 to P6 pupils***

TED provides pupils the platform to explore the different aspects of learning English and make it a fun and exciting experience.   TED allows pupils to journal their thoughts, their views/opinions, likes and dislikes via the use of the Thinking Routines.  This journaling experience provides our pupils with opportunities to read the nuances between lines and go beyond the text.  Journaling opens the doors for them to make connections to school values, the social and emotional learning competencies while enjoying the enriching language learning experiences.
