<tr><td><p align="justify">The ELLE (English Language Learning Experience) journals for Primary 1 and 2 and TED (Tackling English Diligently) journals for Primary 3 to 6 provide students with a platform to explore different aspects of learning English Language and make it a fun and engaging experience. Using Thinking Routines within the Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL-TR) framework, students learn to read between the lines, think critically and creatively, and make connections beyond the text. The journalling experience also cultivates adaptability, as students reflect on their learning, connect their experiences to school values and social-emotional competencies, and take ownership of their language growth.

<tr><td><p align="justify">Our HAL Programme provides selected Primary 4 to 6 students with aptitude in English Language and journal writing opportunities to extend their learning beyond the regular curriculum. Through exposure to complex texts and thought-provoking themes, students engage in meaningful discussions that encourage them to exchange perspectives, consider multiple viewpoints, and challenge ideas respectfully. Analytical writing, creative responses, and purposeful journalling enable students to articulate insights, refine their thinking, and reflect on both intellectual and emotional responses to texts. The programme nurtures empathy and critical thinking as students learn to question assumptions, appreciate diverse viewpoints, make connections beyond the text, and engage thoughtfully with literature and the world around them.

Discussions and creative activities encourage students to think critically about issues relevant to their lives and society. The programme develops future-ready learners who can appreciate diverse perspectives, communicate thoughtfully, and connect what they read to their own experiences and the world around them. <img style="margin-bottom: 8px; width=1600" src="/images/Students%20Activities%20Photos/EL3.jpg"></p>
