# PROGRAMME FOR ACTIVE LEARNING (PAL)

The **Programme for Active Learning**, also known as PAL, is one of PERI’s recommendations to address the increased emphasis on holistic education and development of life skills. It provides a smooth transition for children from pre-school child to primary education.

With Primary 1 and 2 pupils in mind, PAL emphasises learning through **hands-on experiences**, having **fun and enjoyment** in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for **peer interaction and self-discovery**.

PAL complements Art, Music and Physical Education. It provides a platform for the children to extend, reinforce and apply their learning through a wide range of activities in the four areas – **Sports & Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts**. PAL also places emphasis on values education and social emotional learning.

PAL@BTPS aims to give pupils holistic and diverse learning experiences through the Appreciation, Creation and Express (ACE) approach. The ACE approach in PAL will equip pupils with the ability to appreciate art, confidence to be expressive and creative in problem solving.

Through PAL, pupils will be enthused, engaged and empowered in a Learning Community that inculcates sound values and equips them to be world-ready citizens, which is in-line with our school’s mission.

All Primary 1 and 2 pupils have a 2-hour PAL lesson once a week during curriculum time. These PAL modules are experiential in nature and incorporate learning in a creative, fun and enjoyable way.
