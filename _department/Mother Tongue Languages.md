<p align="justify"><strong>Overview: </strong><br>Our MTL curriculum and programme seek to inspire a love for learning through fun, engaging and student-centered experiences that develop confident communicators, empathetic leaders and adaptive learners. By integrating pedagogies such as EdTech, Differentiated Instruction (DI), Inquiry-Based Learning through the Thinking Routine (IBL-TR), experiential learning and gamification, we create authentic and meaningful learning experiences. Students explore language through real-world contexts, collaborative discussions, and interactive digital tools that cater to their diverse learning needs. These approaches not only strengthen their language proficiency but also deepen their cultural appreciation, enabling them to connect with their heritage, value cultural diversity, and thrive as future-ready global citizens.</p>

<tr><td><p align="justify">P3 and P4 HMT students engage in journaling as a platform to reflect on real-world issues using the students’ newsletter as a key resource. Through journaling, students read selected articles, explore current&nbsp;affairs&nbsp;and express their thoughts,&nbsp;opinions&nbsp;and emotions in writing. Guided by Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) and thinking routines, they question,&nbsp;analyse&nbsp;and make meaningful connections between what they read and their own experiences. This journaling process nurtures adaptive learners who think critically, reflect&nbsp;deeply,&nbsp;and respond&nbsp;thoughtfully to the world around them.</p>

Using enriched texts, literary appreciation,&nbsp;debate&nbsp;and authentic&nbsp;tasks—interviews, community storytelling—students&nbsp;practise&nbsp;advanced language features while deepening intercultural awareness.&nbsp;Feedback cycles&nbsp;emphasise&nbsp;clarity&nbsp;and ethical reasoning.&nbsp;Experiential learning&nbsp;anchor language in real needs, training students to listen before leading and&nbsp;acting&nbsp;with care. By joining linguistic growth with empathy-building experiences, HMT&nbsp;nurtures bilingual, bicultural communicators who bridge differences and serve as thoughtful, compassionate leaders.</p>
