# PHYSICAL EDUCATION


The purpose of physical education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. (PE Teaching and Learning Syllabus 2014)

In BTPS, the Physical Education (PE) Department’s vision is aligned to our ministry’s purpose.  In addition, we believe that being physically active, contributes positively to pupils’ attitude towards learning holistically.

We believe that PE lessons should be experiential and provide teaching learning moments for our pupils that go beyond the classrooms.  It builds character, develops social skills, fosters teamwork and encourages fair play as they enjoy each carefully planned PE lesson by our Qualified Physical Education Teachers (QPETs).

PE is essential, purposeful movement.  When children can relate PE skills and knowledge to movement in real life, they find purpose and take ownership of their learning.  This helps to inculcate character values such as resilience and respect which will aid them in their decision making in their lives.

In BTPS, we focus on broad-based development and the wide scope of activities and events integrated in our PE programme, can develop the fundamental movement and games skills of every pupil.  And with the infusion of Physical Health and Fitness with Physical Education lessons in schools today, PE lessons are now linked to life in the pupils’ lives.  The experience of enjoyable PE lessons is a way we at BTPS would like our pupils to cultivate the love and adopt a physical lifestyle which will be an asset in the pupils’ lives that stays with them even after they leave our school.
