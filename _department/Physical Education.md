# PHYSICAL EDUCATION


The BTPS Physical Education (PE) department aims to cultivate in our pupils, the love for an active lifestyle though engaging and fun lessons while also equipping them with the skills to do sporting activities safely.

We believe that true growth occurs when individuals are pushed out of their comfort zones. Our PE lessons incorporate, fun, interactive and challenging activities within game contexts. 

By conquering these challenges with a dare-to-try attitude, pupils will develop a sense of accomplishment and gain confidence in their abilities. In the long run, they will use these skills to pursue a physically active lifestyle. 

The well-being of our pupils is of utmost importance. We prioritise safety during all physical activities, ensuring that our pupils adhere to safety guidelines and are aware of potential risks.

We believe in the importance of building resilience and ruggedness in our pupils. These qualities not only contribute to physical strength but also foster mental toughness and the ability to overcome challenges. 

Injuries are a natural part of any physically active person's journey, and learning to cope with setbacks and bounce back stronger is crucial for their long-term well-being. 

We encourage pupils to view minor injuries as a learning opportunity. As in the case with children trying out new activities, there will be scrapes and bruises in the process. Our teachers discuss with them the factors that might have contributed to the injury and how they can prevent similar incidents in the future.

Social interaction in physical education plays a pivotal role in fostering holistic development among our pupils. It goes beyond the physical aspect, providing opportunities for them to learn important social skills and build meaningful connections. 

To further develop our pupils holistically, pupils will undergo these programs throughout their years at Bukit Timah Primary School:

<h3>Leadership through PE</h3>
We recognise and groom pupil leadership through PE lessons. Selected pupils undergo leadership training and are tasked to support their PE teachers as PE monitors. 

<h3>Healthy Living Programme</h3>
For children to grow well and have the energy to enjoy school and leisure. we aim to teach our pupils how to balance a healthy diet, good sleeping habits and sufficient physical activity. Through experiential learning, talks and other activities, BTPS pupils will develop the awareness, knowledge and desire to lead a healthy and active lifestyle beyond primary school. 

<h3>Sports Boy and Sports Girl of the Year</h3> 
The BTPS Sports Boy and Sports Girl Awards are given annually to two graduating pupils who have demonstrated the ideals of sportsmanship, by showcasing the school values of Graciousness, Respect, Resilience, Adaptability, Compassion and Integrity in their CCAs and represented BTPS in a <b>school-organised CCA</b> at a zonal or national level competition, i.e, the National School Games. The pupil athlete will be selected from the Primary 6 level by their CCA teachers for the year.
