<p align="justify"><strong>Overview:</strong><br>At Bukit Timah Primary School, we believe every child can enjoy and succeed in Mathematics. Our Mathematics Department nurtures curious and confident problem-solvers who approach challenges with adaptability and resilience. We design meaningful learning experiences that spark inquiry, collaboration and reflection, helping students see the relevance of Mathematics in their daily lives. Through engaging lessons, hands-on exploration, and open discussions, students build strong understanding, logical thinking, and clear communication. By encouraging perseverance and curiosity, we aim to help every learner experience the joy of mathematical discovery and grow into adaptive thinkers who are ready to take on future challenges. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Department mission:</strong><br>

<tr><td><p align="justify">Mathematics journalling provides students with opportunities to reflect on ;their learning, explain their reasoning, and make meaningful connections between mathematical ideas. Across all levels, students are guided to reason logically, explore different strategies, and develop metacognitive abilities as they reflect on their learning journey. Through regular journal entries supported by thinking routines, students learn to communicate their thinking clearly using mathematical language, diagrams, and examples. These routines deepen reflection and help students articulate what they notice, wonder, and understand. </p>
<p align="justify">
The journalling process strengthens critical thinking as students justify their approaches, builds adaptive thinking as they revise strategies based on new insights, and encourages inventive thinking as they explore alternative methods or create their own representations. Over time, journalling nurtures confident and thoughtful learners who take ownership of their learning and see Mathematics as a dynamic and connected discipline.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style="background-color: #f48470;"><strong><font color="ffffff">Future-Makers: Math Through Financial Literacy &amp; STEM </font></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align="justify">Through financial literacy tasks and STEM-based challenges, students experience Mathematics as a practical, useful and creative subject. They learn to budget, analyse information, make informed choices and design simple solutions. These experiences show them how mathematical thinking supports everyday decisions and drives many of today’s innovations. </p>
<p align="justify">
As students work together to explore ideas, test prototypes and reflect on their learning, they become more confident in tackling unfamiliar problems and more comfortable thinking critically and creatively. These experiences encourage them to ask questions, consider alternatives and use Mathematics to make sense of real-life situations. </p>
<p align="justify">
By connecting mathematical concepts to everyday decisions and emerging technologies, the programme nurtures habits that prepare students to be future-ready — adaptable in new situations, thoughtful in their choices, and equipped with the reasoning skills needed to thrive in a world shaped by innovation and change.</p>

<tr><td style="background-color: #74cdd7;"><strong><font color="ffffff">Math Enrichment Lab: Extending Ideas and Challenges</font></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><p align="justify">Our Enrichment Programme offers selected Primary 4 to 6 students opportunities to go beyond the standard curriculum and explore Mathematics at greater depth. Through platforms such as Math Olympiad Training, E2K and MathExpert@Work, students engage with complex, non-routine problems that require flexible thinking, creative reasoning and strategic problem-solving.</p> 
<p align="justify">
These experiences nurture adaptive learners who can adjust their approaches when faced with unfamiliar challenges, consider alternative strategies and persist through difficulty. As students explore advanced concepts, they learn to embrace uncertainty, refine their thinking, and see mistakes as part of the learning process. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
By engaging in collaborative investigations and Olympiad competitions, students build confidence, strengthen ;higher-order thinking skills and experience the excitement of uncovering mathematical ideas in new and meaningful ways. The programme not only deepens their appreciation for Mathematics, but also equips them with the adaptability and resilience needed to thrive in more complex learning environments.</p>
