<p align="justify">At Bukit Timah Primary School, we believe every child can enjoy and succeed in Mathematics. Our Mathematics Department nurtures curious and confident problem-solvers who approach challenges with adaptability and resilience. We design meaningful learning experiences that spark inquiry,&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;and reflection, helping students see the relevance of Mathematics in their daily lives. Through engaging lessons, hands-on exploration,&nbsp;and open discussions, students build strong understanding, logical thinking,&nbsp;and clear communication. By encouraging perseverance and curiosity, we aim to help every learner experience the joy of mathematical discovery and grow into&nbsp;adaptive&nbsp;thinkers who are ready to take on future challenges. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Department mission:</strong><br>
To design meaningful experiences that engage students in problem solving through inquiry, collaboration and reflection, grounded in real-world applications.
</p>

<strong>Objectives:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Develop students’ confidence, adaptability,&nbsp;and resilience in mathematical problem solving.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Strengthen conceptual understanding and procedural fluency through inquiry-based learning.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cultivate logical reasoning, clear communication,&nbsp;and reflective thinking.</li>&nbsp;
<li>Nurture positive attitudes towards Mathematics and appreciation of its real-world relevance.</li>
</ul>

<tr><td><p align="justify">Mathematics journalling provides students with opportunities to reflect&nbsp;on&nbsp;their learning, explain their reasoning,&nbsp;and make meaningful connections between mathematical ideas. Across all levels, students are guided to reason logically, explore different strategies,&nbsp;and develop metacognitive&nbsp;abilities&nbsp;as they reflect on their learning journey.&nbsp;Through regular journal entries&nbsp;supported by thinking routines,&nbsp;students learn to communicate their thinking&nbsp;clearly using mathematical language, diagrams,&nbsp;and examples.&nbsp;These routines deepen reflection and help students articulate what they notice, wonder,&nbsp;and understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
The journalling process&nbsp;strengthens critical thinking as students justify their approaches, builds adaptive thinking as they revise strategies based on new insights, and encourages inventive thinking as they explore alternative methods or create their own representations. Over time, journalling nurtures confident&nbsp;and&nbsp;thoughtful learners who take ownership of their&nbsp;learning&nbsp;and see Mathematics as a dynamic and connected discipline.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
