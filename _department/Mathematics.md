# MATHEMATICS
**OUR PROGRAMMES**

With a vision of **‘Love Mathematics, Enjoy Mathematics, Think Mathematics’**, the Mathematics Department seeks to nurture every BTPS student to be a creative problem-solver with a passion for Mathematics. We aim to provide holistic mathematics programmes that emphasize on conceptual understanding, skill proficiencies and thinking skills. The department takes a systematic approach to engage our students through a meaningful and enriching 6-year learning journey.

**Develop the Love for Mathematics through engaging leaners in the acquisition of the Basics with Fun**

As the lower primary students are in the early stages of learning mathematics, the lessons are infused with many hands-on activities to keep learning of mathematics fun and practical and at the same time, ensure acquisition of basic concepts. Students are also exposed to mathematics interactive games to reinforce their learning in an engaging manner.
