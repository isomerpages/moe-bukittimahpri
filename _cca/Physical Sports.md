For every game, every practice session, we live up to our motto to “Never Surrender”. </p><img style="width:80%" src="/images/School%20Photos/football.png">

<h3>RUGBY</h3><p align="justify">
Rugby is a sport that evokes images of fierce battles on the field. It showcases the epitome of physicality, skill, and unyielding determination. At its core, rugby is a game of strategy, teamwork, and controlled aggression. Played with an oval-shaped ball, the sport demands a delicate balance of power, agility, and precise execution. From the adrenaline-pumping scrums to the daring tackles, every moment on the rugby field is an opportunity for players to showcase their skills and push the limits of their abilities. One of the distinguishing features of rugby is its inclusivity. However, rugby is more than just a physical battle. It is a sport that instills values and virtues that extend beyond the boundaries of the field.</p>
