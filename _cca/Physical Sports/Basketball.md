<h3>BASKETBALL</h3><p align="justify">
BTPS Basketball is a dynamic CCA dedicated to fostering resilience, respect and passion for the game. Officially established in 2022, the CCA attracts pupils looking for a supportive and growth-oriented sporting experience. We pride ourselves on creating an inclusive CCA where players of all backgrounds and skill can thrive. With the schoolâ€™s new Indoor Sports Hall, we are able to provide a great learning and playing environment to the players. </p>
<p align="justify">
We believe that resilience and respect are fundamental values both on and off the court. We encourage our players to develop mental toughness, perseverance, and the ability to overcome challenges. Through rigorous training sessions, intense competitions, and a supportive team environment, we instill a resilient mindset that helps our pupils reach their full potential. We also emphasize the importance of respect in all aspects of the game. Our players are taught to respect their coaches, teammates, opponents, referees, and the game.</p>
