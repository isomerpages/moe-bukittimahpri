<h3>WUSHU</h3><p align="justify">
Wushu is a captivating sport that combines grace, power, and agility. It is an art form that has been practiced for centuries. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including kicks, punches, and acrobatics. Pupils are introduced to the fundamentals of Wushu, which include mastering basic stances, learning routines and understanding the philosophy behind this ancient practice. </p>

In Bukit Timah Primary School, we would like to students to develop physical coordination and instill essential values such as discipline, resilience, and teamwork by practising Wushu. It is also a CCA that embraces cultural diversity and offers a unique platform for pupils of all backgrounds to come together to experience the beauty of Wushu. </p>
