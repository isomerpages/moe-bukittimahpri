<h3>Wushu</h3>
<p align="justify">
In Wushu, students develop foundational and intermediate skills in both traditional forms and modern routines. Through regular training, students learn a range of techniques, including stances, forms, kicks, and basic weapon handling, while building discipline, focus, and respect for&nbsp;the art.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Beyond skill development, the CCA prepares students for performances and competitions, helping them apply their skills with confidence and composure. Students are guided to work towards personal improvement and team success, developing&nbsp;perseverance,&nbsp;and&nbsp;a strong sense&nbsp;of commitment through their training journey.</p>
