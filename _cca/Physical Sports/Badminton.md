<h3>Badminton</h3>

<p align="justify">The Badminton CCA provides students with a supportive environment to develop their badminton skills and teamwork. Through training sessions, students learn to improve their techniques, understand basic strategies, and adapt their play when facing different opponents. These experiences help students grow in confidence and become more thoughtful players.</p>
