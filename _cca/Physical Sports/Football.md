<h3>FOOTBALL</h3><p align="justify">
Our Football CCA is named the BTPS Invictus Football Club. ‘Invictus’ means unconquered in Latin. While there is always a winner and a loser in football, we remind ourselves that we are winners when we are gracious, when we give our best and when we do not give up. For every game, every practice session, we live up to our motto to “Never Surrender”. </p><img style="width:90%" src="/images/School%20Photos/football.png">

<p align="justify">
We instill the values of discipline, commitment, sportsmanship and camaraderie during training. We focus on building up good character in the members and ensure that our selection for the school team takes into account character and values. </p>

This year, our Senior and Junior boys team participated in the National School Games. Our Senior team played in the Qualifying round of the West Zone competition and made it to the 2nd round. They achieved 8th position. They also participated in the Assumption English School Challenge Cup where they came in second. Our Junior boys played in the National School Games and qualified for Tier 1 and eventually came in second in the group at the end of the tournament. </p>
