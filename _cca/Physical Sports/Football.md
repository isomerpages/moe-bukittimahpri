<h3>Football&nbsp;(Boys)</h3>
<p align="justify">
The BTPS Football CCA, Invictus,&nbsp;emphasises&nbsp;discipline, coordination, and purposeful teamwork as&nbsp;students&nbsp;develop&nbsp;ball control&nbsp;and&nbsp;positioning&nbsp;skills, and game awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
CCA practices&nbsp;focus on effort, consistency, and responsibility. Students work on improving their skills and fitness while learning to apply&nbsp;game&nbsp;tactics, make decisions under pressure, and support one another during training and match situations. Through these experiences, students develop resilience and learn to respond positively to challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Through&nbsp;football, students learn to be committed&nbsp;team&nbsp;players who respect others and take responsibility for their actions. These experiences help them develop confidence and perseverance that extend beyond&nbsp;sport.</p>
