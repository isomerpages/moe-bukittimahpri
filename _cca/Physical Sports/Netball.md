<h3>NETBALL</h3>
<p align="justify">BTPS Netball is a dynamic CCA committed to nurturing confident, resilient, and respectful individuals through the exciting and fast-paced game of netball. Established in 2025, the CCA attracts students who value teamwork, personal growth, and a strong sense of camaraderie. We provide an inclusive and nurturing environment where every girl is empowered to learn, compete, and flourish—regardless of her starting point.</p>
<p align="justify">
Our players are guided to value effort, attitude, and teamwork, both during training and in competition. Through purposeful training sessions, friendly matches, and the annual National School Games (NSG), our students gain not only technical skills but also life lessons in perseverance, sportsmanship, and integrity.</p>
<p align="justify">
As a new CCA, we can only participate in competitions or external events when we have enough students to form a full team. We welcome enthusiastic individuals who are ready to grow with the team and contribute to laying the foundation for future success.</p>
