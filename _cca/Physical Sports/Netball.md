<h3>Netball&nbsp;(Girls)</h3>
<p align="justify">BTPS Netball is committed to nurturing confident, resilient, and respectful students through participation in a fast-paced&nbsp;team&nbsp;sport. Though relatively new, the CCA has attracted students who value teamwork, personal growth, and&nbsp;a strong sense&nbsp;of camaraderie. Players are supported in learning, competing, and improving at their own pace within an inclusive and encouraging environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Students are guided to focus on effort, attitude, and teamwork during both training and match play. Through purposeful training sessions and competitive opportunities, they develop netball skills while learning perseverance, sportsmanship, and integrity. Emphasis is placed on supporting one another and responding positively to challenges&nbsp;on&nbsp;court.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
As the CCA continues to grow, BTPS Netball provides students with opportunities to contribute to the team’s development and work towards shared goals.&nbsp;Over time, students grow in confidence and resilience while developing a positive approach towards sport.</p>
