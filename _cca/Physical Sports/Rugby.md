<h3>Rugby&nbsp;(Boys)</h3>
<p align="justify">
Members of the BTPS Rugby CCA, the Highlanders,&nbsp;are passionate about Rugby,&nbsp;a physically demanding team sport that requires strength, awareness, and teamwork as they run, pass, and contest possession to advance play.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
In recent years, the CCA has grown stronger through the determination and commitment of its&nbsp;members. Their perseverance has helped to sustain and strengthen the team, reflecting the resilience needed in rugby training and match play. Through participation, students develop physical endurance, quick decision-making, and mental toughness.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Rugby also&nbsp;emphasises&nbsp;respect and responsibility, as students learn to support one another and uphold fair play on and off the field. Working together through challenges, the Highlanders&nbsp;have built&nbsp;a strong sense&nbsp;of unity and pride in their team.</p>
