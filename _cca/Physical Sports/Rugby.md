Rugby is a dynamic sport where two teams compete to score points by carrying, passing, and kicking the ball towards their opponent's goal line. It's a game known for its intense physicality, strategic play, and teamwork.</p>

Bukit Timah Primary School’s rugby team is known as Highlanders. As a team, we aim to not only develop strength and skill but also quick thinking and coordination on the field. The Highlanders have had opportunities to learn about the values of resilience, teamwork and discipline through training sessions and during competitions. </p>
