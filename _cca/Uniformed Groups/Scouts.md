<h3>Scouts</h3>
<p align="justify">
Guided by the Scout Promise and Law, Scouting at BTPS provides students with opportunities to develop character, responsibility, and care for others. Through hands-on activities such as First Aid, outdoor cooking, camping, and community service, scouts build practical life skills while learning to contribute positively to their school and the wider community.</p>
<p align="justify">
Weekly sessions help students develop discipline, adaptability, and resilience as they work together in teams and respond to challenges. Scouts learn to support one another, take initiative, and&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;confidence through shared experiences and outdoor learning.</p>
<p align="justify">
Leadership responsibilities within the troop&nbsp;provide&nbsp;opportunities for students to guide and support their peers, strengthening their sense of responsibility and empathy. Through Scouting, students are nurtured to become confident team players who lead with care and purpose.</p>
