# Scouts
<p align="justify">
Scouting develops children in an intellectually and physically stimulating environment. Our cub scouts learn to manage themselves and take care of their peers. In doing so, they get hands-on leadership experience. </p>

<p align="justify">
Our pupils will also acquire life skills during activities such as camping and first aid skills which are taught during our weekly sessions. We aim to instill the values of teamwork and resilience through our activities.</p>
