<h3>Scouts</h3>
<p align="justify">
Guided by the Scout Promise and Law, Scouting at BTPS provides students with opportunities to develop character, responsibility, and care for others. Through hands-on activities such as First Aid, outdoor cooking, camping, and community service, scouts build practical life skills while learning to contribute positively to their school and the wider community.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Weekly sessions help students develop discipline, adaptability, and resilience as they work together in teams and respond to challenges. Scouts learn to support one another, take initiative, and&nbsp;grow in&nbsp;confidence through shared experiences and outdoor learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Leadership responsibilities within the troop&nbsp;provide&nbsp;opportunities for students to guide and support their peers, strengthening their sense of responsibility and empathy. Through Scouting, students are nurtured to become&nbsp;confident&nbsp;team players who lead with care and purpose.</p>
