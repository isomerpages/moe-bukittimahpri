# Scouts
<p align="justify">
Guided by the Scout Law and Promise, scouting at our school offers a stimulating environment that develops both intellectual and physical skills. Scouts learn essential life skills such as First Aid, outdoor cooking, and camping. Our weekly sessions focus on character building, aiming to cultivate disciplined, adaptable, and resilient team players.</p>

<p align="justify">
Scouts also have opportunities to take on leadership roles through positions such as Sixer or Assistant Sixer, leading teams of six members. In recognition of their exceptional leadership and contributions, two of our scout leaders were honored with the Akela Award in 2024, the highest accolade for Cub Scouts in Singapore.</p>
<p align="justify">
Through practical skill-building, we prepare our scouts for real-life situations. Service to others fosters a sense of pride and community contribution. Additionally, recreational sports and activities provide a fun way for scouts to bond, enjoy themselves, and create lasting memories with their peers.</p>
