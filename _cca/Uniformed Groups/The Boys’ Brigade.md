<h3>The Boys’ Brigade (56J Company) </h3>

<p align="justify">The Boys’ Brigade at BTPS (sponsored by the Church of Singapore, Bukit Timah) seeks to nurture boys to serve and lead, grounded in Christian values and with a strong emphasis on character development and ;sense of responsibility. The 56J Company provides a structured and supportive environment where boys grow through regular parades, drills, First Aid training, and participation in brigade-wide activities such as Character Quest and camps.</p>
<p align="justify">
Through teamwork, outdoor activities, and shared experiences, boys develop resilience, empathy, and respect for others. Opportunities for collaboration and parent-child bonding further strengthen relationships and encourage boys to make responsible decisions as part of a community. </p>
<p align="justify">
Guided by the Boys’ Brigade motto, “Sure and Steadfast,” members are supported in building confidence, leadership skills, and a steadfast character that guides them in their learning journey. </p>
