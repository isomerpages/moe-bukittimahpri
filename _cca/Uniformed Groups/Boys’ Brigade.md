# The Boys’ Brigade (56J Company) 

<p align="justify">The Boys’ Brigade at BTPS&nbsp;(sponsored by the Church of Singapore,&nbsp;Bukit Timah)&nbsp;seeks&nbsp;to nurture boys to serve and lead, grounded in Christian values and&nbsp;with&nbsp;a strong emphasis on character development and&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;responsibility. The 56J Company provides a structured and supportive environment where boys grow through regular parades, drills, First Aid training, and participation in brigade-wide activities such as Character Quest and camps.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Through teamwork, outdoor activities, and shared experiences, boys develop resilience, empathy, and respect for others. Opportunities for collaboration and parent-child bonding further strengthen relationships and encourage boys to make responsible decisions as part of a community.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Guided by the Boys’ Brigade motto, “Sure and Steadfast,” members are supported in building confidence, leadership skills, and a steadfast character that guides them in their learning journey. </p>
