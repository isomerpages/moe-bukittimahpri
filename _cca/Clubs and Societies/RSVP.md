<h3>RSVP (Respect, Save &amp; Value Our Planet)</h3>
<p align="justify">
RSVP is a Science and Environmental Club that nurtures students’ curiosity about the world around them and encourages responsible care for the environment. Members take part in hands-on science experiments, STEM-based activities, and environmental initiatives that allow them to explore scientific concepts and apply their learning to real-world contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Through investigations and projects related to topics such as recycling and sustainability, students learn to think critically and take ownership of their learning. Opportunities to engage with external partners and&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in workshops further broaden students’ understanding of environmental issues and eco-friendly practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
By contributing to school-wide initiatives and outreach efforts, RSVP members develop a growing sense of responsibility towards their community and the environment. Through these experiences, students become more confident, reflective, and motivated learners who are committed to making positive contributions to a sustainable future.</p>
