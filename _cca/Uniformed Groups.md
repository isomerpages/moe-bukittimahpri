# Boys’ Brigade 

<p align="justify">The Boys’ Brigade mission is to nuture youth, based on Christian values, to serve and lead. 56J Company achieved the Distinction Award for the prestigious JM Fraser Award for Excellence for Year of Assessment 2023. Besides learning badge work such as drills and First Aid, our boys are also challenged to participate in Brigade-wide competitions such as Character Quest and get the opportunity to fellowship with Boys from other schools through a Combined camp.</p>
<p align="justify">Boys learn leadership skills through exposure in weekly parades that include overnight camps, outings and activities to help foster parent-child bonding. Boys learn many different values like teamwork, respect and resilience and we hope they will live out the BB moto to be “Sure and Steadfast”.  </p>

# Scouts
<p align="justify">
Scouting develops children in an intellectually and physically stimulating environment. Our cub scouts learn to manage themselves and take care of their peers. In doing so, they get hands-on leadership experience. </p>
<p align="justify">
Our pupils will also acquire life skills during activities such as camping and first aid skills which are taught during our weekly sessions. We aim to instill the values of teamwork and resilience through our activities.</p>
