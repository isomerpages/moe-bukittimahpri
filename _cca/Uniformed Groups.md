# Boys’ Brigade 

<p align="justify">The Boys’ Brigade mission is to nuture youth, based on Christian values, to serve and lead. 56J Company achieved the Distinction Award for the prestigious JM Fraser Award for Excellence for Year of Assessment 2023. Besides learning badge work such as drills and First Aid, our boys are also challenged to participate in Brigade-wide competitions such as Character Quest and get the opportunity to fellowship with Boys from other schools through a Combined camp.</p><br>
<p align="justify">Boys learn leadership skills through exposure in weekly parades that include overnight camps, outings and activities to help foster parent-child bonding. Boys learn many different values like teamwork, respect and resilience and we hope they will live out the BB moto to be “Sure and Steadfast”.  </p>
