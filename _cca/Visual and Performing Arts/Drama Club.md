<h3>Drama Club</h3>
<p align="justify">
The Drama Club provides an environment where creativity and collaboration thrive. Students engage in theatrical activities such as acting, improvisation, scriptwriting, and stage production. These experiences enhance artistic skills while building lasting friendships and&nbsp;a strong sense&nbsp;of community.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
As they take part in rehearsals and stage productions, students develop resilience by learning to persevere through challenges with determination. They cultivate empathy by appreciating different perspectives and stepping into varied roles, which helps them connect more deeply with others. Students also&nbsp;practise&nbsp;responsibility by taking ownership of their roles and contributing meaningfully to the group’s success.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
The Drama Club nurtures students’ talents while instilling important values, preparing them for future challenges both on and off the stage.</p>
