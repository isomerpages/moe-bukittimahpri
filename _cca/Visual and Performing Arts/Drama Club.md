<h3>DRAMA CLUB</h3><p align="justify">
Drama Club aims to develop confident speakers and performers. Our members get to explore creative expression through theatrical techniques such as mime, physical theatre, role playing, characterisation, improvisation, voice projection and spatial awareness.</p>
<p align="justify">
More importantly, CCA members cultivate values of teamwork, discipline and perseverance through their love and appreciation for drama. The Club performs annually for school events in a short drama production. It also trains hosts and emcees for different school events.  </p>
