<h3>International&nbsp;Dance (Dance-Versity)</h3>
<p align="justify">
Dance-Versity&nbsp;is a vibrant CCA where students explore a variety of dance styles and express themselves creatively through movement. Through structured dance training and performance opportunities, students learn to be adaptable as they try new choreography, collaborate with different teammates, and respond confidently to challenges. This supports the school’s vision of developing Adaptive Learners who think flexibly and embrace new experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Students also build discipline, teamwork, and confidence as they work towards improving their dance techniques. They learn to coordinate as a group, listen to feedback, and perform with pride. Over time, students grow in creativity and responsibility,&nbsp;demonstrating&nbsp;respect for one another during training sessions and performances while developing&nbsp;a strong sense&nbsp;of commitment to the CCA.</p>
