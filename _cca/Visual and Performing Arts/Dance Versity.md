<h3>DANCE-VERSITY</h3><p align="justify">
At Dance-Versity, our students embody the core school values of respect, resilience, compass, and adaptability. Through a diverse range of dance styles, our members learn to respect different cultures and traditions, while resilience is cultivated through rigorous training and practice. The compass guides them to make ethical choices and stay true to their values, and adaptability allows them to thrive in the ever-changing world of performing arts.</p>
