<h3>BRASS SYMPHONIA</h3>
<p align="justify">BTPS Brass Symphonia brings together students who love music and want to take their skills to the next level. As part of the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) Tier 2, the band offers a fun and supportive environment where students make music, build friendships, and learn important life lessons. Through regular practices, students develop resilience, commitment, and teamwork — all while enjoying the process of creating music together.

Guided by dedicated instructors and teachers, band members improve their musical skills and get to participate in band exchanges with local and overseas schools, gaining new perspectives and experiences. The band is also supported by parents and alumni, who often contribute to the band’s efforts and encourage the students in their musical journeys.</p>
