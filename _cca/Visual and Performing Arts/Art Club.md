<h3>Art Club</h3>
<p align="justify">
In Art Club, students explore their creativity through painting, drawing, sculpture, and mixed-media art in an inclusive and supportive setting. They are given opportunities to embark on learning journeys and&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in masterclasses with local artists, gaining inspiration and deeper insights into different artistic practices. Through creative challenges, students develop resilience as they experiment with ideas and push their artistic boundaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Within a collaborative environment, students learn to appreciate diverse artistic expressions and work meaningfully with others. They&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;responsibility by taking ownership of their artistic journey, while showing adaptability as they explore a range of techniques and mediums across different projects.</p>
