<h3>ART CLUB</h3><p align="justify">
The Art Club is a vibrant and inclusive community within our school, dedicated to nurturing the creative spirit of our pupils. It provides a platform for students to explore various art forms, express themselves, and develop their artistic skills beyond what is offered in the curriculum. </p>
<p align="justify">
In Art Club, students engage in a range of activities such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and mixed media. Alongside technical proficiency, we strive to instil important values such as creativity, imagination, teamwork, and self-expression. </p>
<p align="justify">
Our commitment to excellence and passion for the arts have led to our noteworthy achievement of receiving a “Certification of Recognition” in the prestigious Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition in July 2023.</p>
