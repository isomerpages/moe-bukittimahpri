<h3>ART CLUB</h3><p align="justify">
The Art Club is a vibrant and inclusive community within our school, dedicated to nurturing the creative spirit of our students. It provides a platform for students to explore various art forms, express themselves, and develop their artistic skills beyond what is offered in the curriculum. Students engage in a range of activities such as painting, drawing, sculpture, and mixed media. Alongside technical proficiency, we strive to instill important values such as creativity, imagination, teamwork, and self-expression. </p>
<p align="justify">
Our students' adventurous spirit leads them to exciting projects like The Council for Third Age (C3A) Intergenerational Learning Programme, road safety messages with Land Transport Authority (LTA), and Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Exhibition. </p>
<p align="justify">
We believe Art is about the journey and passion behind each creation, and we foster a supportive environment where resilience and exploration shape the creative thinkers of tomorrow.</p>
