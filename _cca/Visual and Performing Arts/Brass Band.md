<h3>Brass&nbsp;Band (BTPS Brass Symphonia)</h3>
<p align="justify">BTPS Brass Symphonia provides students with the opportunity to learn and perform music using brass and percussion instruments. Through structured training and performance experiences, students strengthen their instrumental skills while gaining a deeper appreciation for music.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
Students are exposed to a wide range of musical pieces, from classical to contemporary works. They learn proper playing techniques, basic music theory, and how to perform as part of an ensemble. Regular practice helps students improve their musical expression, listening skills, and overall musical understanding.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">
The CCA reinforces the value of responsibility as members care for their instruments, attend rehearsals punctually, and support one another during practices and performances. Through hands-on learning and group music-making, students develop teamwork, confidence, and a sense of belonging, forming lasting friendships and a lifelong love for music.</p>
