<tr><td><p align="justify">At Bukit Timah Primary School, our Values-in-Action (VIA) programme believes that character is not only learned but lived. VIA provides every student with opportunities to understand, practice, and demonstrate values through meaningful action. </p>
<p align="justify">Our VIA framework is <strong>progressive and developmentally aligned</strong>, guiding students to recognize and expand their circle of care over time.</p>
<p align="justify">Our VIA progression guides students to widen their circle of care: <br>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Self</strong>– Learn to take responsibility for one’s own actions and well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Peers</strong> – Show empathy, respect, and support towards classmates. </li>
<li><strong>School Environment</strong> – Take ownership in caring for shared spaces and routines. </li>
<li><strong>Wider Community</strong>– Contribute positively to the community beyond the school. </li></ul><p></p><img style="width:60%; max-width:800px; height:auto;" src="/images/Students%20Activities%20Photos/viaframework.png">
