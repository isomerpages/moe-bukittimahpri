</tbody></table> 
<p align="justify">At Bukit Timah Primary School, our ALP develops&nbsp;<strong>adaptive learners</strong>&nbsp;who can think critically, collaborate effectively, and navigate complexity with confidence. Our IBL-TR approach combines&nbsp;<i>Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL)&nbsp;with&nbsp;Thinking Routines (TR)</i>&nbsp;to help pupils ask meaningful questions, explore multiple perspectives, and reflect deeply on their learning experiences.</p>
<p align="justify">
Through guided inquiry, pupils make their thinking visible, build confidence and resilience, and learn to adapt to&nbsp;new ideas&nbsp;and challenges. Teachers act as facilitators, encouraging pupils to take ownership of their learning, embrace uncertainty, and learn from mistakes — key habits of an adaptive, self-directed learner.</p>
<h3>Inquiry-Based Learning through the 5E Learning Cycle</h3>
<p align="justify">
Using the <strong>5E Learning Cycle</strong> (<em>Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate</em>), pupils:
</p>
<p align="justify">
</p><ul>
  <li>Pose meaningful questions</li>
  <li>Actively seek answers</li>
  <li>Explain their thinking clearly</li>
  <li>Connect learning to real-life contexts</li>
  <li>Reflect and grow over time</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p align="justify">
<strong>IBL-TR</strong> nurtures learners who are curious, open-minded, and ready to 
learn, unlearn, and relearn — essential traits for thriving in a fast-changing world.
</p>
<h3>Key ALP Programmes</h3>

<p align="justify"><strong>1. Journaling Across English-Medium Subjects</strong><br>
Across all English-medium subjects, pupils use Thinking Routines to reflect on and
consolidate their learning. They draw, write, and record their ideas in journals,
helping them slow down, think deeply, and make their thinking visible. Over time,
journaling strengthens independence, clarity of expression, and ownership of learning.
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>2. Learning Plots (Traditional Planting &amp; Hydroponics)</strong><br>
Through Learning Plots, pupils experience how food is grown using traditional
soil-based methods (P3) and hydroponics (P4). They observe plant growth, ask questions,
and document their findings through IBL-TR. This authentic experience helps pupils
appreciate food production, sustainability, and the relevance of science to daily life.
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>
3. STEM Programme (Strawbees, Micro:bits and Sensors)</strong><br>
The STEM programme provides hands-on learning through design challenges, coding, and
simple robotics. Pupils build structures with Strawbees, create prototypes, and
programme Micro:bits with sensor inputs. These experiences strengthen problem-solving,
computational thinking, and creativity, while helping pupils apply Science concepts in
meaningful, real-world contexts.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>4. LiFE – Literature for Everyone</strong><br>
Each level explores one key text—<em>Queen of the Sky</em> (P3),
<em>House on Silat Road</em> (P4), and <em>The Mudskipper</em> (P5).
Through discussions, reflections, and inquiry into themes and characters, pupils learn
to interpret stories, appreciate diverse perspectives, and express their views with
empathy, clarity, and confidence.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>5. Lower Primary Exploration</strong><br>
Using STELLAR units such as <em>A Butterfly is Born</em> and
<em>Antz in a Hurry</em>, young learners are encouraged to observe their surroundings,
pose questions, and express ideas through drawing, writing, and simple investigations.
This early exposure to inquiry builds foundational curiosity and strengthens thinking
and communication skills.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>6. Super Journaling Team (SJT)</strong><br>
The Super Journaling Team brings together P4 and P5 pupils with a strong interest in
reflective writing. Through termly masterclasses, pupils explore issues from multiple
perspectives, use routines such as Connect–Extend–Challenge, and support their ideas
with evidence. They deepen their inquiry skills and extend their journaling to connect
with the community and the wider world.
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>7. Work Like a Scientist (WLAS)</strong><br>
WLAS immerses pupils in authentic scientific inquiry through hands-on Plant Tissue
Culture (PTC) sessions in the school’s PTC Lab. Pupils learn how plants can be grown from
small tissue samples and observe their development over time. They practise collecting
evidence, refining ideas, and reflecting like real scientists, building perseverance,
curiosity, and confidence.
