<p align="justify"><strong>BTPS Character Development Structure </strong><br>
At Bukit Timah Primary School, character development is intentionally designed and nurtured across all levels. The Character Development Structure articulates the expected behaviours students are guided to develop as they grow in self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, and responsible decision-making. </p>
<p align="justify">By making expectations explicit and progressive, this structure provides a common language for students, teachers, and parents. It helps students understand what positive character looks like in action, reflect on their growth, and take increasing ownership of their behaviour and choices in school and beyond. </p>
<p align="justify">
To support this developmental journey, Level Mottos are used to anchor character expectations in age-appropriate language. Each motto highlights key focus areas for the level, guiding students to practise the school’s values through their daily routines, interactions, and learning experiences.
