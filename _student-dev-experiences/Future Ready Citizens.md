At Bukit Timah Primary School, we nurture Future-Ready Citizens who ;are informed, responsible, and adaptable, and who contribute meaningfully to their community. Students learn to make thoughtful decisions, embrace diversity, and take ownership of their actions in an increasingly complex and connected world. 
<p align="justify">
Through <strong>National Education (NE)</strong>, <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> programmes, and <strong>Cyber Wellness</strong> education, students develop civic mindedness and a sense of identity and an understanding of their role as Singaporeans. They learn to appreciate different perspectives, act responsibly both online and offline, and work collaboratively to build a better future. </p>
<p align="justify">
These experiences help students to grow into confident and ethical individuals who are prepared to navigate change, use technology responsibly and contribute positively to society.</p>

<tr><td><p align="justify">National Education helps students understand Singapore’s story and their place within it. Through shared experiences and meaningful engagement, students develop identity, empathy, and a strong sense of belonging within our diverse BTPS community — where locals, new citizens, and international students learn and grow together.</p>
<p align="justify">
Through National Education, students develop a <strong>sense of belonging</strong>, a <strong>sense of reality</strong>, and a <strong>sense of hope</strong>, which together culminate in the <strong>will to act</strong>. These dispositions are nurtured through the intentional integration of Citizenship Dispositions in our NE Commemorative Events, Social Studies curriculum, and Learning Journeys, helping students grow into informed, concerned, and participative citizens who contribute meaningfully to their school, community, and nation.
</p>	
<p align="justify"><strong>NE Commemorative Events</strong><br>
Our students commemorate Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day through storytelling, exhibitions, and student-led activities. Each event strengthens appreciation for Singapore’s resilience and diversity, helping students connect national values to daily actions.</p><br>

Our VIA progression guides students to widen their circle of care: <br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self</strong>&nbsp;– Learn to take responsibility for one’s own actions and well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Peers</strong> – Show empathy, respect, and support towards classmates. </li>
<li><strong>School Environment</strong> – Take ownership in caring for shared spaces and routines. </li>
<li><strong>Wider Community</strong>&nbsp;– Contribute positively to the community beyond the school. </li></ul><img style="width:60%; max-width:800px; height:auto;" src="/images/Students%20Activities%20Photos/viaframework.png">

<p align="justify">As part of our school-wide approach, Cyber Wellness messages are meaningfully integrated across platforms such as Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons and school-wide assemblies. Through scenario-based discussions, reflective activities, and authentic stories, students develop digital empathy, understand online safety, practise balanced screen-time habits, and learn to make thoughtful and responsible choices in the digital world. </p>
