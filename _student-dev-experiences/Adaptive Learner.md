Adaptive Learners ask questions, explore possibilities, and persevere through challenges. They think critically, reflect on their learning, and adapt to different situations with creativity and confidence. By staying open-minded and flexible, they continue to grow and thrive in an ever-changing world. </p>
<p align="justify">
Through our <strong>Level Signature Programmes, Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW), and the Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong>, students engage in authentic tasks where they explore, collaborate, and apply learning beyond the classroom. These experiences build confidence, creativity and the mindset to thrive in a changing world. </p>

At Bukit Timah Primary School, the Peer Support Relationship (PSR) programme is a key part of our commitment to nurturing students’ holistic development and well-being — ensuring that every child feels safe, valued, and connected within our school community. Guided by the belief that <i>“Everyone is a Peer Supporter,”</i> the programme fosters a culture of care and belonging, where students support one another socially and emotionally. </p>
<p align="justify">Aligned with the MOE PSR Framework and the “CHEER” model, our PSR initiatives equip students with both practical and emotional strategies to care for their peers and promote positive relationships. Through these efforts, students learn to stay calm, listen empathetically, encourage help-seeking, and refer peers to trusted adults when needed — strengthening the foundation of a caring and connected school culture.</p>

<p align="justify">Through key platforms such as school-wide;assembly, class-based PSR activities, the Back-to-School Programme,Exploration Weekand enhanced FTGP lessons, students progressively acquire and practise peer support skills in a spiral approach from Primary 1 to Primary 6. This approach ensures that as students mature, their understanding of peer bonding, empathy, and peer helping deepens — empowering them to take ownership of their relationships and contribute actively to a caring school culture.</p>
