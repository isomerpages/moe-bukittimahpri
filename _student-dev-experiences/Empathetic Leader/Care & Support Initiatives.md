<tr><td><p align="justify"><strong>Student Management at BTPS</strong><br>
At BTPS, we are committed to nurturing a safe, caring, and inclusive environment where every child feels valued and supported. Our approach focuses on <strong>Discipline with Dignity</strong>, guiding students with school rules, positive routines, and differentiated approaches to meet their individual needs. This ensures all students can learn, grow, and glow in a safe and respectful environment.</p>
<p align="justify">Through these efforts, we aim to develop students who embody our school vision: <strong>Adaptive Learners, Empathetic Leaders, and Future-Ready Citizens</strong>.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Tier 1: School-Wide Support for All Students</strong><br>
Tier 1 initiatives establish a positive and supportive school environment where <strong>clear expectations, shared values, and a sense of belonging</strong> guide students’ behaviour and learning. <br></p>

<p align="justify">Through school-wide structures such as <strong>cohort talks, assemblies, and consistent teaching of routines and expectations</strong>, students learn how to act responsibly, respect others, and contribute positively to the school community. These universal supports help all students feel safe, supported, and ready to learn. </p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Tier 2: Care and Support Initiatives</strong><br>
We recognise that some students may require <strong>additional guidance and support</strong> at different points in their development. Tier 2 initiatives provide <strong>targeted programmes</strong>to support students’ social, emotional, and behavioural growth<br></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Step Up and Shine On (SuSo)</strong><br>
SuSo supports students who may be shy or still developing confidence. Through guided activities and opportunities to collaborate with peers, students build <strong>self-belief, social skills, and confidence</strong>, enabling them to step forward and shine.<br></p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Nurturing Emotions, Managing Ourselves (NEMO)</strong><br>
NEMO focuses on developing social skills, managing impulsivity, and regulating emotions. Students engage in <strong>structured strategies led by teachers, group work, discussions, and hands-on activities</strong>, applying what they learn while building self-regulation and positive relationships. These targeted sessions provide guidance and opportunities for students to navigate challenges and develop confidence, resilience, and self-awareness—qualities that help them become adaptive learners, empathetic leaders, and future-ready citizens.</p>
