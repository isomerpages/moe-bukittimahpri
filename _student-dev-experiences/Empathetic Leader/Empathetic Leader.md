<p align="justify"><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Empathetic Leaders understand themselves and others. They show care, respect, and integrity in their actions, and make responsible choices that positively impact those around them. By listening, including, and encouraging others, they help create a caring and enabling school community where everyone feels valued and supported. 
</p><p align="justify">
Through our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP), Peer Support Relationship (PSR) Programme</strong>, and <strong>Student Leadership Development</strong>, students develop empathy and moral courage to lead by example. </p>
<p align="justify">
Care and Support initiatives such as <strong>NEMO</strong> and <strong>SuSo</strong> further nurture a sense of belonging, offering additional guidance for students who need more support or confidence to connect, grow, and shine.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><i><span style="color: #4b0082">“Every child carries their own light. When we nurture them with care, strengthen them with routines, guide them with consistent discipline, and give them different platforms to grow, that light grows, glows, and shines brightly.” </span></i></strong><i><br>
