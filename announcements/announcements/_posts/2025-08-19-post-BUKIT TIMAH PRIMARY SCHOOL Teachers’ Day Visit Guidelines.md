Dear Alumni<br>
If you would like to visit your former teachers at Bukit Timah Primary School on **4 September 2025 (Thursday)**, please follow the guidelines below to help ensure that visits are smooth and enjoyable for everyone:


     1. **Arranging Your Visit**: Please check if your teachers are available on the day and make arrangements directly with them. Upon arrival, meet your teachers at the school gate.

     2. **Visit Timing**: Visits are scheduled from **11.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.** If you arrive before 11.00 a.m., please wait without blocking the school entrances or interfering with the dismissal process. We also request that you keep your visits brief to allow teachers time to rest after the morning’s celebrations.

     3.	**Designated Areas**: For the convenience and safety of all, please limit your visit to the ground-floor areas only.

We appreciate your cooperation in helping to maintain the order and cleanliness of our school. Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to welcoming you back to BTPS.

**Bukit Timah Primary School**
