<br>Dear Alumni</p>
<p>If you would like to visit your former teachers at Bukit Timah Primary
School on <strong>4 September 2025 (Thursday)</strong>, please follow the
guidelines below to help ensure that visits are smooth and enjoyable for
everyone:
<br>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Arranging Your Visit</strong>: Please check if your teachers are
available on the day and make arrangements directly with them. Upon arrival,
meet your teachers at the school gate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visit Timing</strong>: Visits are scheduled from <strong>11.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.</strong> If
you arrive before 11.00 a.m., please wait without blocking the school entrances
or interfering with the dismissal process. We also request that you keep
your visits brief to allow teachers time to rest after the morning’s celebrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Designated Areas</strong>: For the convenience and safety of all,
please limit your visit to the ground-floor areas only.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We appreciate your cooperation in helping to maintain the order and cleanliness
of our school. Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to
welcoming you back to BTPS.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Bukit Timah Primary School</strong>&lt;/p&gt;</p>
