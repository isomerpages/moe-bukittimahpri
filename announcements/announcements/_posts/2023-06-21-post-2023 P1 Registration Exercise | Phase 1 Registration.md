Dear Parents / Guardians

Phase 1 registration is for a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident (PR) child born between 2 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 (both dates inclusive) and has a sibling currently studying in our school. 

For the 2023 P1 Registration Exercise (2023 P1 Ex), parents who are registering their younger child under Phase 1 are to register during the Phase 1 registration period from 4 July 2023 (Tuesday), 9am to 5 July 2023 (Wednesday), 4.30pm through the P1 Registration Portal. 

You may refer to [MOE P1 website for information on the 2023 P1 Ex](https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration). 

Thank you.

Yours faithfully<br>
Bukit Timah Primary School
